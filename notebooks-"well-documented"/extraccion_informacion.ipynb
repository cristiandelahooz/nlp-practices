The fact is that the struggle which this young yet already sorely tried Organization has waged, and is still waging, is the best proof of the timeliness of its conception and creation, and of the urgent and imperious need for the work it is doing today.\\n2.\\tCertainly this has not been merely another episode in the political history of the peoples. The recent wars, with their unparalleled violence and enormous destructive power, engendered in the peoples a boundless desire for peace, concord and agreement. That is why the United Nations (united for agreement, concord and peace) neither can nor should be regarded as one of those familiar panaceas created for interested motives in international political laboratories with the object of providing temporary compromise solutions for more or less selfish problems; it must be recognized for what it is, a sacred idea conceived by the peoples at a time of grave and legitimate struggle for the permanent protection of their democratic existence, autonomy, dignity, peace and security.\\n3.\\tFor these reasons it is a crime to obstruct it in its sacred mission. It is a crime to try to reduce it to a tool of selfish ideologies. It is a crime to use it as an instrument of war in times of peace. It is a crime not to render it due honour.\\n4.\\t“We the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war…” Thus reads the opening sentence of the Preamble of the United Nations Charter.

In particular, I thank the members of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States for the trust placed in us. Our purpose during our term will be to contribute a voice for Latin America and the Caribbean to one of the forums for greater  global responsibility  in   the   maintenance of peace.\\nOf course, we are committed to asserting, both in the Security Council and in the Assembly, the same unbreakable principles that guide us as a nation. Respect for human rights, democracy, freedom and diversity will therefore be the beacon that we will follow in order to guide our work in the Security Council. We will do everything possible to honour the trust placed in us, being fully aware that, although fragile, stability and security are priority objectives that must be preserved and progress made towards, step by step and day by day.\\nIt is clear to us that in a space that addresses issues that can change the course of history and the fate of millions of people, we cannot seek easy and drastic solutions, which in any case do not exist.

At the close of the seventh session of the General Assembly, all the peoples devoted to international order, freedom and prosperity felt a deep satisfaction based on the heartfelt hope that, with the signing of the armistice at Panmunjom and the tangible results achieved there, there had been ensured not only, the final cessation of hostilities in the martyred land of Korea but also the initiation and success of negotiations that would lead to the speedy restoration of peace in that country, which had suffered premeditated aggression at the hands of governments whose goal was world domination by violence and hatred, in full accordance with the baneful purposes of international communism.\\n2.\\tFor the vast majority of the member States of the international community, and especially for the small countries like the Dominican Republic, the success of the action undertaken and sustained by the initiative and under the auspices of the United Nations in defence of right and justice has shown, at the cost of' indescribable suffering and sacrifice, the urgent need for organizing and putting into effect a powerful system of defence of the international community, based on the requirements of collective security.\\n3.\\tIf it is possible to single out, among the essential purposes of the United Nations Charter, one that can be considered as most important, it is that which requires that the moral force of justice should be constantly strengthened by the categorical and effective warning that the days when might was right have gone forever. Thus the United Nations is based on the outright condemnation of aggression and violence, and on due submission to the principles and rules under which the life of the international community is organized and developed. The Charter is, in short, the triumphant proclamation of the values of the spirit as against the schemings of force and materialism which bring in their train destruction, poverty, suffering and death.\\n4.\\tIt is, then,...</td>\n",

We appreciate his dedication in the search for solutions to the conflicts that have shaken the world over the past 10 years, and we wish him the best of luck in the new tasks that he will undertake.\\nThe year 2016 is proving to be especially turbulent, with territorial conflicts and open identity-related tensions in various parts of the world. We hope and insist, of course, that the international community will find a peaceful outcome to those conflicts — first and foremost for the sake of the millions of lives that are affected by them. Sometimes the urgency inherent in those tragedies weakens our commitment to address problems that appear to be less pressing but are the most important in the long term.\\nOne such issue, with perhaps the largest scope and greatest potential for long-term transformation, is the fight against poverty and inequality. Over the past two decades, the rapid economic growth brought about by economic globalization has fuelled high expectations in the countries of the South. In fact, it was believed that the prosperity enjoyed by a few countries might finally be within everyone’s reach. It should be recognized that those hopes were not unfounded.

At the outset, I would like to apologize on behalf of Mr. Danilo Madina Sánchez, President of the Dominican Republic, for his absence from the debate, as he has had to return to our country to deal with Hurricane Maria.\\nOur meeting this week coincides with the devastating season of natural disasters that our region has been enduring for nearly a month with terrible consequences. The disasters have also spread to Mexico, which has been hit by two destructive earthquakes, and the southern United States, viciously punished by Hurricane Harvey. In the catalogue of human suffering caused by Hurricane Irma, that of Antigua and Barbuda stands out, particularly Barbuda, 90 per cent of whose infrastructure has collapsed, according to its Prime Minister, Gaston Browne. Hardly had Irma’s devastating winds dropped than Maria arrived, leaving a new trail of destruction and death, inflicting a direct hit first on Dominica and today on its neighbour Puerto Rico, causing great destruction and damage.\\nWe take this opportunity to express our solidarity with Puerto Rico, which is also our neighbour, as well as with all the countries affected. The people of the Dominican Republic offer their deepest sympathy for the destruction and the large numbers of victims. Accurate figures for the damage done on Saint Barthélemy, Saint Maarten, Anguilla, the Virgin Islands, Tortola, Turks and Caicos, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and especially Florida and Cuba, have yet to be determined. However, we can say that they have suffered substantial damage, that recovery will take years and that, tragically, valuable lives have been lost.\\nTo give Member States an idea of how severely we have been affected, despite the lack of definitive figures, I can say that the material losses caused by this hurricane season alone far exceed the gross domestic product of the Dominican Repub...</td>\n",

The three regular sessions of the Assembly of the United Nations had been held in the three countries of the world which most strongly represented the principles of political freedom and of respect for individual rights. The United Nations Organization, born in San Francisco, had been initiated in London; it had drawn its first breath in England, as though it had been desired that the representatives of all the nations should strengthen their faith in the renewal of liberty by the splendid sight of a famous people which had just arisen from the ruins of war, as a symbol of the indestructibility of the human spirit and as a symbol of justice and right — values which would never die, however persecuted.\\nThe General Assembly had then moved to the United States of America, the most powerful democracy on earth and the home of the people which had decided the issue of the tremendous conflict by throwing into the balance the most formidable fighting machine that the world had ever seen.\\nThe capital of France, the country which, with the Encyclopedists, had seen the birth of the loftiest ideals of modern political thought, now welcomed the United Nations.

That debate takes on new meaning in the current context, following the wave of fires in the Amazon and the recent passage of Hurricane Dorian, which left behind a trail of shocking damage and many victims.\\nIt should be noted that for us and our Caribbean region, the effects of climate change are real, visible and devastating, and threaten the very existence of our countries.

That\\nfact is extremely encouraging for countries like my own\\nthat have struggled for many years, especially during the\\nconstructive phase of our present constitutional Government,\\nto give the status of women its proper attributes. We\\ntherefore celebrate as a victory of our own, in close\\nharmony with our beliefs, the fact that an illustrious\\nrepresentative of the loftiest ideals of human justice and\\ntalent has been unanimously elected by all Member States\\nrepresented here.\\n\\n2. Under your enlightened guidance, the General\\nAssembly is embarking upon one of its most promising\\nsessions, at a time when the agenda before us includes items\\nof the utmost gravity and importance.\\n\\n3. The supreme position you now occupy at the twenty-fourth\\nsession reminds us of the notable presidence of\\nanother eminent figure, Mrs. Vijaya Laksmi Pandit, who\\nconducted the eighth session of the General Assembly with\\nthe same ability that we look for from you in view of your\\nacknowledged experience and understanding of the problems\\nwhich are a source of concern and disquiet to all\\nnations.\\n\\n4.

At the last session of the Assembly this same honour\\nfell to Mr. Emilio Arenales, an eminent Latin American,\\nnow deceased, to whose memory I should like to pay a\\nposthumous tribute for the wisdom with which he guided\\nour activities on that occasion, and for the admirable and\\nunflinching courage with which he faced adversity in the\\ndifficult tasks he accomplished.\\n\\n6.

If the United Nations is to achieve the purpose for which it was setup, namely to bring States together with a view to promoting peace and improving the conditions in which man lives, on the basis of a general concept that necessarily embraces the whole of mankind, it must cease to be the restrictive war-time coalition which it was at its inception and must steadily reduce the hazard and uncertainty surrounding the conception of the qualifications required of an existing political entity before it can become a Member State.\\n4.\\tJust as the exaggerated pressure of the different political ideologies which divide the world today invests some of the applications for admission to the Organization with an element of artificiality, so, too, the struggle for the principle of self-determination is being waged with varying success in the context of the atmosphere of conflict in which the fundamental purposes of the Charter are being achieved.\\n5.\\tDespite adverse circumstances in which the principle of universality is being debated, recent sessions of the Assembly indicate that in the long run the imperative requirements of international life will prevail over subje...</td>\n",

That should be clear to us by now because, in a globalized world, there are no borders when it comes to the effects of epidemics, conflicts and violence. Precisely because ours is such an intertwined world, far-reaching goals always require “transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, as the theme of this session of the General Assembly aptly puts it.\\nIt is essential to recognize that this Organization needs major reforms to shake it out of the comfort in which it has been operating. It must be stressed that what is important to our countries is to consolidate a renewed multilateralism.

The fact is that the struggle which this young yet already sorely tried Organization has waged, and is still waging, is the best proof of the timeliness of its conception and creation, and of the urgent and imperious need for the work it is doing today.\\n2.\\tCertainly this has not been merely another episode in the political history of the peoples. The recent wars, with their unparalleled violence and enormous destructive power, engendered in the peoples a boundless desire for peace, concord and agreement. That is why the United Nations (united for agreement, concord and peace) neither can nor should be regarded as one of those familiar panaceas created for interested motives in international political laboratories with the object of providing temporary compromise solutions for more or less selfish problems; it must be recognized for what it is, a sacred idea conceived by the peoples at a time of grave and legitimate struggle for the permanent protection of their democratic existence, autonomy, dignity, peace and security.\\n3.\\tFor these reasons it is a crime to obstruct it in its sacred mission. It is a crime to try to reduce it to a tool of selfish ideologies. It is a crime to use it as an instrument of war in times of peace. It is a crime not to render it due honour.\\n4.\\t“We the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war…” Thus reads the opening sentence of the Preamble of the United Nations Charter. Yet, today one of these nations, “determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” is viol...   \n",

This is a special occasion for our country, because next year the Dominican Republic will sit on the Security Council as a non-permanent member for the first time.\\nOn behalf of  the Dominican people and myself,    I would therefore like to start by thanking the States Members of the United Nations for the support we have received in joining the Security Council. In particular, I thank the members of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States for the trust placed in us. Our purpose during our term will be to contribute a voice for Latin America and the Caribbean to one of the forums for greater  global responsibility  in   the   maintenance of peace.\\nOf course, we are committed to asserting, both in the Security Council and in the Assembly, the same unbreakable principles that guide us as a nation. Respect for human rights, democracy, freedom and diversity will therefore be the beacon that we will follow in order to guide our work in the Security Council. We will do everything possible to honour the trust placed in us, being fully aware that, although fragile, stability and security are priority objectives that must be preserved and progress made towards, step by step and day by day.\\nIt is clear to us that in a space that addresses issues that can change the course of history and the fate of millions of people, we cannot seek easy and drastic solutions, which in any case do not exist.

At the close of the seventh session of the General Assembly, all the peoples devoted to international order, freedom and prosperity felt a deep satisfaction based on the heartfelt hope that, with the signing of the armistice at Panmunjom and the tangible results achieved there, there had been ensured not only, the final cessation of hostilities in the martyred land of Korea but also the initiation and success of negotiations that would lead to the speedy restoration of peace in that country, which had suffered premeditated aggression at the hands of governments whose goal was world domination by violence and hatred, in full accordance with the baneful purposes of international communism.\\n2.\\tFor the vast majority of the member States of the international community, and especially for the small countries like the Dominican Republic, the success of the action undertaken and sustained by the initiative and under the auspices of the United Nations in defence of right and justice has shown, at the cost of' indescribable suffering and sacrifice, the urgent need for organizing and putting into effect a powerful system of defence of the international community, based on the requirements of collective security.\\n3.\\tIf it is possible to single out, among the essential purposes of the United Nations Charter, one that can be considered as most important, it is that which requires that the moral force of justice should be constantly strengthened by the categorical and effective warning that the days when might was right have gone forever.

This fact should, however, only spur it on to greater efforts for the benefit of mankind.\\nA few hours after the treacherous attack on Pearl Harbor, the Dominican Republic, honouring its tradition of law and its international engagements, resolutely went to war to show its solidarity with, and to share the fortunes of, the victim of that hateful aggression, thus taking part at its side in the hazards and responsibilities of the struggle for the defence of freedom of the peoples, and of human dignity. In conformity with this attitude, on the historic occasion of the third meeting of Foreign Ministers in Rio de Janeiro, we championed a joint declaration of war by all the American nations against the totalitarian powers. For the sake of continental solidarity, we supported the agreements there adopted, although they were in fact less radical than the position taken up and the views maintained by the people and Government of the Dominican Republic.\\nAs soon as victory began to dawn on the horizon, victory won at the price of such cruel sacrifices, we devoted all our energies to securing effective collaboration in the efforts at San Francisco to produce a world organization worthy of the high destiny of mankind and of civilization.\\nOnce the proposal which brought the United Nations into bang had taken final shape, we placed all our reserves of faith and hop...   \n",

I wish to begin my remarks with a special recognition of the work of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We appreciate his dedication in the search for solutions to the conflicts that have shaken the world over the past 10 years, and we wish him the best of luck in the new tasks that he will undertake.\\nThe year 2016 is proving to be especially turbulent, with territorial conflicts and open identity-related tensions in various parts of the world. We hope and insist, of course, that the international community will find a peaceful outcome to those conflicts — first and foremost for the sake of the millions of lives that are affected by them. Sometimes the urgency inherent in those tragedies weakens our commitment to address problems that appear to be less pressing but are the most important in the long term.\\nOne such issue, with perhaps the largest scope and greatest potential for long-term transformation, is the fight against poverty and inequality. Over the past two decades, the rapid economic growth brought about by economic globalization has fuelled high expectations in the countries of the South. In fact, it was believed that the prosperity enjoyed by a few countries might finally be within everyone’s reach. It should be recognized that those hopes were not unfounded. Indeed, over the course of those two decades, hundreds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty.\\nBut we cannot let ourselves be carried away by excessive optimism. We have an obligation to clarify the scope of those gains in the light of the actual data. We must also expand our horizons to observe those places and areas where globalization has not kept the promises made to humankind.\\nTo begin with, we must remember that all of the hundreds of millions of people who were recently lifted out of poverty did not automatically become part of the middle class, nor did all who wer...   \n",

At \\nthat time, we were facing one of the most dramatic \\ncrises in the modern history of the Dominican \\nRepublic. \\n Since we took the reins of administration in 2004, \\nthe Dominican Republic has managed to recover the \\nconfidence of investors and entrepreneurs.

The fact is that the human and natural elements in our difficult task of reconciling various aspirations, ideals and interests are so prominent that we are at times dramatically made aware of our shortcomings, of obvious areas of disagreement and of lack of comprehension.\\n161.\\tHow, then, can we achieve peace? That is the main concern of the delegation representing the Dominican Republic at this eleventh session of the General Assembly, which is attended by the largest number of Member States in its history — the old founder States, like our own, those which joined later, and the new Members which are to offer us their much-needed cooperation, inasmuch as we agree that the universality of the United Nations, one of our long-standing hopes, is one of the main objectives of the Charter.\\n162.\\tYet the task of achieving peace has its price and is beset with thorny problems. The price must be paid in respect of any human endeavour and the thorny problems will arise because no path is ever entirely smooth.

At the outset, I would like to apologize on behalf of Mr. Danilo Madina Sánchez, President of the Dominican Republic, for his absence from the debate, as he has had to return to our country to deal with Hurricane Maria.\\nOur meeting this week coincides with the devastating season of natural disasters that our region has been enduring for nearly a month with terrible consequences. The disasters have also spread to Mexico, which has been hit by two destructive earthquakes, and the southern United States, viciously punished by Hurricane Harvey. In the catalogue of human suffering caused by Hurricane Irma, that of Antigua and Barbuda stands out, particularly Barbuda, 90 per cent of whose infrastructure has collapsed, according to its Prime Minister, Gaston Browne. Hardly had Irma’s devastating winds dropped than Maria arrived, leaving a new trail of destruction and death, inflicting a direct hit first on Dominica and today on its neighbour Puerto Rico, causing great destruction and damage.\\nWe take this opportunity to express our solidarity with Puerto Rico, which is also our neighbour, as well as with all the countries affected. The people of the Dominican Republic offer their deepest sympathy for the destruction and the large numbers of victims. Accurate figures for the damage done on Saint Barthélemy, Saint Maarten, Anguilla, the Virgin Islands, Tortola, Turks and Caicos, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and especially Florida and Cuba, have yet to be determined. However, we can say that they have suffered substantial damage, that recovery will take years and that, tragically, valuable lives have been lost.\\nTo give Member States an idea of how severely we have been affected, despite the lack of definitive figures, I can say that the material losses caused by this hurricane season alone far exceed the gross domestic product of the Dominican Repub...   \n",

The finest tribute that could be paid to this extraordinary man, this standard-bearer of peace, this apostle of brotherhood, would be to have all the nations represented here join selflessly in choosing as his successor someone capable of serving the United Nations with the same lofty spirit of self-sacrifice as he displayed in the cause of furthering the unity and solidarity of the human family. This tribute would also be extended to the great Swedish nation, which has given this world Organization two martyrs: Count Bernadotte, who fell heroically in the deserts of the Middle East, and now Dag Hammarskjold, struck down by the same fatality which has pursued all redeemers since God Himself died on the cross to give us an example of the power of blood to inspire great causes and great human ideals.\\n4.\\tFor perhaps the first time in the history of the United Nations, a country of the Americas is re-entering this world Organization after having acquired the moral licence to belong to an institution founded precisely to defend the right of man to live in a world free from fear and injustice.

Our ideals of peace and justice in international relations have found in Mr. Belaúnde, with his brilliant intelligence, his scholarship, backed by solid religious and moral convictions and his moving eloquence, an outstanding champion in each of the phases in the history of our Organization which he so admirably described in his speech of acceptance [795th meeting].

The admission of these Members to the Organization is a further step on the way to decolonization, and the fact that when the Charter was signed in 1945 there were fifty-one Members, whereas today the original number has more than doubled, with African nations predominating among the new Members, shows how much progress has been made.\\n3.\\tThe remarks of the Dominican Republic on this occasion and at this stage of the general debate will, in view of the present circumstances, necessarily be very brief and be confined to some aspects of the problems which most directly concern it within the framework of the United Nations.

These problems and disputes reflect the most varied aspects of the serious social and political crisis through which our generation is passing m these difficult times, and they confront the world with the terrible threat of war and destruction. Our participation in the noble work of the General Assembly is based, as always, upon an imperative desire for international co-operation.

       "46  Mr. BALAGUER said that it was the first time that the General Assembly of the United Nations had met on the soil of France, the mother of liberty and the cradle of human rights. If the atmosphere of the world were at present less charged with anxiety and if the shadow of a fresh catastrophe did not darken the future of humanity, it would have been said that that change of headquarters, apart from whatever other motives involved, fulfilled a purpose of incalculable moral value. The three regular sessions of the Assembly of the United Nations had been held in the three countries of the world which most strongly represented the principles of political freedom and of respect for individual rights. The United Nations Organization, born in San Francisco, had been initiated in London; it had drawn its first breath in England, as though it had been desired that the representatives of all the nations should strengthen their faith in the renewal of liberty by the splendid sight of a famous people which had just arisen from the ruins of war, as a symbol of the indestructibility of the human spirit and as a symbol of justice and right — values which would never die, however persecuted.\\nThe General Assembly had then moved to the United States of America, the most powerful democracy on earth and the home of the people which had decided the issue of the tremendous conflict by throwing into the balance the most formidable fighting machine that the world had ever seen.\\nThe capital of France, the country which, with the Encyclopedists, had seen the birth of the loftiest ideals of modern political thought, now welcomed the United Nations. France, a great country, which was the pride of Latin culture, would by its history give the moral impulse required to overcome the feelings of distrust and pessimism which were beginning to undermine the foundations of the United Nations as in its last days they had those of the League of Nations.\\nThe Dominican Republic, heir, like all the La...   \n",

Questions like the international control of atomic energy or the reduction and limitation of armaments could be solved provided we first reach general agreement on the manner in which peace is to be maintained and strengthened. We should also be on the way to finding practical and useful solutions for problems like those connected with the threats to the political independence and territorial integrity of certain Members of this world Organization. If we attain agreement on methods, we shall have gone halfway towards putting them into effect.\\n121.\\tI therefore attach the utmost importance to the item arising out of the report of the Collective Measures Committee, for, if we were to succeed in taking a unanimous decision on it we should be able, sooner or later, to solve all the other political problems before us.\\n122.\\tNevertheless, the prospect before us is not encouraging. From the very first meeting of this session the sharp division of opinion on political problems has made itself felt. At earlier sessions, as we set to work, we were hopeful of reaching practical results in the political sphere and it was only as the days went by that the deep divergence of views became apparent, postponing the adoption of a concerted plan for peace and security.

In the year 2000, it was believed — \\nand this is still the case today — that the objectives \\nestablished at that time would go down in the common \\nhistory of humankind as the bravest ethical decision \\never taken in the face of extreme poverty, the shame of \\ngeneralized injustice and the heartbreaking tragedy of \\nsocial inequity. It was an agenda of work and \\ndedication that required a large dose of political will, \\nactions laid out in conformity with the goals to be \\nreached, a reorganization of budgetary priorities and a \\n \\n \\n21 08-51749 \\n \\ngreater flow of aid resources and support for \\ndevelopment.  \\n We did not undertake the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals in vague terms. We did not couch \\nthe Millennium Declaration in abstract and \\ngrandiloquent concepts lacking in substance. Quite the \\ncontrary, we analysed with the greatest possible rigour \\nthe situation that we wanted to correct. We measured \\nwith mathematical precision its overwhelming scope \\nand the magnitude of the political and financial effort \\nthat its reversal would require.  \\n We committed to the MDGs with such supreme \\nresponsibility that we even set a date for their \\nachievement: the year 2015. Now we are halfway to \\nthat date, and we face the disheartening situation of an \\ninternational landscape full of obstacles to overcome if \\nwe are to conclude what...   \n",
       "52  This session of the General Assembly is of a very special nature because of its great historical significance. The international community has expressed the hope that the year 1985, in which we are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, will mark the beginning of an era of lasting peace and justice throughout the world, as well as one of social and economic development, progress and independence for all peoples of the world. In view of the great importance that the work of this session will have for the future of our organization, your election, Mr. President, could not have been wiser or more just. You possess not only a thorough knowledge of the work of the United Nations, acquired over a period of many years, but also a broad understanding of the role that the Organization should play in the creation of a better world. Moreover, your election is a recognition of the outstanding role played by Spain in the evolution of the world's culture and the indisputable contribution it has made to the development of the norms and principles governing the conduct of nations in their mutual relations. It is also a significant demonstration of affection for the noble people of Spain, at present living through one of the glorious periods in its history as a result of its steadfast resolve to live under a system in which democracy and justice prevail. In the circumstances, this special session could not have begun under better auspices.\\nI also wish to take this opportunity to pay a most sincere tribute to the magnificent job done by your predecessor, Ambassador Lusaka of Zambia, whose constant devotion to his work and faith in the organization's future allowed him to bring to a successful conclusion all the activities connected with the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the united Nations.\\nIt also gives me great pleasure to mention the dedication and zeal with which the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, is carrying out his important task...   \n",

This year, that commitment was renewed when we assumed a non-permanent seat on its Security Council for the first time, despite being founders of the United Nations. That is, of course, a responsibility that honours and binds us. That is why, we have done our utmost since January to ensure that our contribution to the Council always involves the search for broad consensus, which facilitates decision-making and efficiency.\\nAs part of that work, at the beginning of the year, when we assumed the presidency, we organized an open debate on the impacts of climate-related disasters and their negative effects on international peace and security (see S/PV.8451). That debate takes on new meaning in the current context, following the wave of fires in the Amazon and the recent passage of Hurricane Dorian, which left behind a trail of shocking damage and many victims.\\nIt should be noted that for us and our Caribbean region, the effects of climate change are real, visible and devastating, and threaten the very existence of our countries. In that regard, we are encouraged by the fact that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres convened the Climate Action Summit to address climate action within the broader framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which we were very honoured to attend. We agree with him that climate change is the defining issue of our time and a direct existential threat.

That would make \\navailable resources that, if properly used, could contribute to the \\ndevelopment of the countries of the third world, which are already suffering \\nbecause of heavy public debt...   \n",
       "70  It \\nis an honour to participate in the sixty-ninth session \\nof the General Assembly of the United Nations by \\nrepresenting the people and the Government of the \\nDominican Republic. I wish to express my sincere \\ncongratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as \\nPresident at the current session. I wish to thank the \\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the honour \\nbestowed on our country by inviting us to participate \\nin the Education First initiative. As I hope that he \\nwas able to note in his recent visit to our country, the \\npriority that education is being given in the Dominican \\nRepublic is perhaps the best indicator of the new hopes \\nspringing up in our country. It is true that news of hope \\nis especially valuable these days when it is not very \\nabundant.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, the times we live in \\nraise major challenges for the mission of the \\nOrganization — preserving peace, encouraging \\ndevelopment, making education and health the \\nentitlement of all inhabitants of the Earth. As we are \\nall aware, about six years ago, a crisis that began in \\nthe financial sector of developed countries quickly \\nspread to all productive sectors and has affected the \\nentire planet. The consequences of the economic shock \\ncontinue to be felt and were translated into tens of \\nmillions of unemployed, millions of evictions and deep \\ncuts in social benefits in our countries.\\n\\nThe welfare State, the instrument which produced \\nsome of the greatest advances in development and \\nsecurity in history, was jeopardized. Today, we live \\nthe paradox of seeing how that ideal of sustainable \\ngrowth and social justice becomes more fragile in \\nthe countries of origin, while it is being reborn in \\nemerging countries. While developed countries adopt \\npolicies of austerity and structural adjustments, which \\nare concepts sadly familiar to Latin Americans, we \\nsee how social programmes proliferate in different \\ncorners of the planet, lifting millions out...   \n",

Its efforts to realize the ideals of justice pursued by the United Nations will undoubtedly prove to be an asset to the Organization.The international situation, which grows more alarming each passing day, should be a matter of collective concern to all peaceloving nations and should, of necessity, lead them to strengthen the United Nations.

His personal and professional qualities and his dedication to the path of diplomacy augur well for the outcome of the session.I also congratulate his predecessor, Ambassador Peter Florin, on the exemplary and impeccable way in which he presided over the fortysecond session. His work contributed greatly to the Organization good image. We also wish warmly to congratulate the SecretaryGeneral, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the successes he has scored thanks to his persistent efforts for international peace and cooperation, efforts that have been widely and fully recognized by all members of this world body. The Nobel Peace Prize given to the peacekeeping forces is the best testimony of what we have just said. The SecretaryGeneral report on the work of the Organization in addition to being a source of information of incalculable value for us all is a sure guide to follow in the various situations that exist in the interdependent world of today.As a member of the great Caribbean family I wish also to hail an exceptional Caribbean, the Ambassador of Barbados.

As we are all aware, about six years ago, a crisis that began in the financial sector of developed countries quickly spread to all productive sectors and has affected the entire planet. The consequences of the economic shock continue to be felt and were translated into tens of millions of unemployed, millions of evictions and deep cuts in social benefits in our countries.The welfare State, the instrument which produced some of the greatest advances in development and security in history, was jeopardized. Today, we live the paradox of seeing how that ideal of sustainable growth and social justice becomes more fragile in the countries of origin, while it is being reborn in emerging countries. While developed countries adopt policies of austerity and structural adjustments, which are concepts sadly familiar to Latin Americans, we see how social programmes proliferate in different corners of the planet, lifting millions out of poverty and mitigating inequality.In the Dominican Republic, we still have a lo...</td>\n",

       "0   Had the United Nations not been faced in its five years of existence with countless obstacles, had it not been called upon to deal with so many alarming symptoms in the historical development of a convalescent world, it would be difficult to justify its creation, to welcome its birth and to hang on it, as men hoist a banner to a masthead, the hopes of peace and security of a profoundly disturbed epoch. The fact is that the struggle which this young yet already sorely tried Organization has waged, and is still waging, is the best proof of the timeliness of its conception and creation, and of the urgent and imperious need for the work it is doing today.\\n2.\\tCertainly this has not been merely another episode in the political history of the peoples. The recent wars, with their unparalleled violence and enormous destructive power, engendered in the peoples a boundless desire for peace, concord and agreement. That is why the United Nations (united for agreement, concord and peace) neither can nor should be regarded as one of those familiar panaceas created for interested motives in international political laboratories with the object of providing temporary compromise solutions for more or less selfish problems; it must be recognized for what it is, a sacred idea conceived by the peoples at a time of grave and legitimate struggle for the permanent protection of their democratic existence, autonomy, dignity, peace and security.\\n3.\\tFor these reasons it is a crime to obstruct it in its sacred mission. It is a crime to try to reduce it to a tool of selfish ideologies. It is a crime to use it as an instrument of war in times of peace. It is a crime not to render it due honour.\\n4.\\t“We the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war…” Thus reads the opening sentence of the Preamble of the United Nations Charter. Yet, today one of these nations, “determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” is viol...   \n",
       "1   At the outset, I would like to congratulate Ambassador María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on her election as President of the General Assembly and to wish her every possible success. It is a great honour for me to be able to once again address the Assembly as President of the Dominican Republic. This is a special occasion for our country, because next year the Dominican Republic will sit on the Security Council as a non-permanent member for the first time.\\nOn behalf of  the Dominican people and myself,    I would therefore like to start by thanking the States Members of the United Nations for the support we have received in joining the Security Council. In particular, I thank the members of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States for the trust placed in us. Our purpose during our term will be to contribute a voice for Latin America and the Caribbean to one of the forums for greater  global responsibility  in   the   maintenance of peace.\\nOf course, we are committed to asserting, both in the Security Council and in the Assembly, the same unbreakable principles that guide us as a nation. Respect for human rights, democracy, freedom and diversity will therefore be the beacon that we will follow in order to guide our work in the Security Council. We will do everything possible to honour the trust placed in us, being fully aware that, although fragile, stability and security are priority objectives that must be preserved and progress made towards, step by step and day by day.\\nIt is clear to us that in a space that addresses issues that can change the course of history and the fate of millions of people, we cannot seek easy and drastic solutions, which in any case do not exist. In that context, our country will always be a place of dialogue\\n \\nand understanding, and will always seek peaceful solutions. We are always willing to do whatever it takes to find common ground and support consensus as the best tool for peace and development. We will therefore always ...   \n",

It is not with empty words of vainglory or boasting, but backed by the exact not to say strict expression of historical truth, that I state that never in the history of the United Nations has there appeared before a meeting of the General Assembly a delegation of the Dominican Republic possessing credentials of such remarkable political value as those displayed by the delegation which I have the honour to lead.\\n\\n112.

Honduras which; in this period of its history, is making extraordinary efforts to achieve progress on the road towards development, at this time suddenly has to face the violent forces of destiny. There has been practically total destruction as though an apocalyptic hand wanted to plunge it into despair.

At the close of the seventh session of the General Assembly, all the peoples devoted to international order, freedom and prosperity felt a deep satisfaction based on the heartfelt hope that, with the signing of the armistice at Panmunjom and the tangible results achieved there, there had been ensured not only, the final cessation of hostilities in the martyred land of Korea but also the initiation and success of negotiations that would lead to the speedy restoration of peace in that country, which had suffered premeditated aggression at the hands of governments whose goal was world domination by violence and hatred, in full accordance with the baneful purposes of international communism.\\n2.\\tFor the vast majority of the member States of the international community, and especially for the small countries like the Dominican Republic, the success of the action undertaken and sustained by the initiative and under the auspices of the United Nations in defence of right and justice has shown, at the cost of' indescribable suffering and sacrifice, the urgent need for organizing and putting into effect a powerful system of defence of the international community, based on the requirements of collective security.\\n3.\\tIf it is possible to single out, among the essential purposes of the United Nations Charter, one that can be considered as most important, it is that which requires that the moral force of justice should be constantly strengthened by the categorical and effective warning that the days when might was right have gone forever.

This item relates to measures for providing assistance to my country and to the Commonwealth of Dominica, a small country which, like our own, was cruelly battered by the fury of the hurricanes of this season of cyclones in the Caribbean.\\n2.\\tWe must admit that this, too, represents a contribution to the peace for which the United Nations is fighting so heroically, a contribution which takes into account in circumstances like these, not only the scourge of war, but also the destructive force of nature. This tragedy, which afflicts the peoples suffering from the results of the hurricanes, inevitably gives rise not only to hunger and destruction, but also to all the upsetting results produced when economies are disrupted and when human suffering reaches such depths that it bears comparison with what happens when war, an apocalyptic figure bent upon uprooting the constitutional instrument of the United Nations, is unleashed.\\n3.\\tOur country was the victim in less than five days of two cruel hurricanes which spread tragedy, horror and chaos among its inhabitants, who were hoping for a future of peace and labour in a climate of democracy, and when the Dominican Government had already set up action programmes for the economic development of the nation and had been mobilizing all the forces of production, in many scientifically new and revolutionary areas, in order to make the best ...   \n",

In conformity with this attitude, on the historic occasion of the third meeting of Foreign Ministers in Rio de Janeiro, we championed a joint declaration of war by all the American nations against the totalitarian powers.

We appreciate his dedication in the search for solutions to the conflicts that have shaken the world over the past 10 years, and we wish him the best of luck in the new tasks that he will undertake.\\nThe year 2016 is proving to be especially turbulent, with territorial conflicts and open identity-related tensions in various parts of the world. We hope and insist, of course, that the international community will find a peaceful outcome to those conflicts — first and foremost for the sake of the millions of lives that are affected by them. Sometimes the urgency inherent in those tragedies weakens our commitment to address problems that appear to be less pressing but are the most important in the long term.\\nOne such issue, with perhaps the largest scope and greatest potential for long-term transformation, is the fight against poverty and inequality. Over the past two decades, the rapid economic growth brought about by economic globalization has fuelled high expectations in the countries of the South. In fact, it was believed that the prosperity enjoyed by a few countries might finally be within everyone’s reach. It should be recognized that those hopes were not unfounded. Indeed, over the course of those two decades, hundreds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty.\\nBut we cannot let ourselves be carried away by excessive optimism. We have an obligation to clarify the scope of those gains in the light of the actual data. We must also expand our horizons to observe those places and areas where globalization has not kept the promises made to humankind.\\nTo begin with, we must remember that all of the hundreds of millions of people who were recently lifted out of poverty did not automatically become part of the middle class, nor did all who wer...   \n",

The fact is that the human and natural elements in our difficult task of reconciling various aspirations, ideals and interests are so prominent that we are at times dramatically made aware of our shortcomings, of obvious areas of disagreement and of lack of comprehension.\\n161.\\tHow, then, can we achieve peace?

       "29  Mr. HENRIQUEZ UREÑA said that if ever the United Nations General Assembly had commenced its work in an atmosphere propitious to fruitful mutual collaboration it was on that occasion, when the world political horizon was again bright with hope. The General Assembly was meeting in an atmosphere of tranquillity under the leadership of a distinguished statesman, General Romulo, who could be described as the embodiment of the spirit of human kindness.\\n161.\\tThe task before the Assembly was not easy, nothing was more arduous than the effort to reconcile conflicting ideologies and interests. Good will, however, had power akin to faith, which moved mountains.\\n162.\\tWhile the Assembly agenda covered a vast number of topics, the political items, which occasioned the great differences, were not as numerous as in the past; moreover, they had all been discussed previously.\\n163.\\tThe question of the disposal of the former Italian colonies was of primary importance. Mr. Henriquez Ureña hoped the Assembly would find an equitable and workable solution of the problem during that session; the position of the Dominican Republic thereon had already been clearly indicated and it would remain unchanged. Any solution designed to ensure the preparation of those former colonies for self-government or independence, through an orderly process carried out under the supervision of the United Nations, would have the support of the delegation of the Dominican Republic.\\n164.\\tThe Dominican Republic maintained an equally firm attitude with regard to any problem involving respect for the independence and sovereignty of a State. For that reason it could not remain indifferent to another question which had already been debated in past sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, namely, the threat to the political independence and territorial integrity of Greece. Not only was the sacred principle of independence attacked by such threats but also another principle, that of non-intervention, ...   \n",

The disasters have also spread to Mexico, which has been hit by two destructive earthquakes, and the southern United States, viciously punished by Hurricane Harvey. In the catalogue of human suffering caused by Hurricane Irma, that of Antigua and Barbuda stands out, particularly Barbuda, 90 per cent of whose infrastructure has collapsed, according to its Prime Minister, Gaston Browne. Hardly had Irma’s devastating winds dropped than Maria arrived, leaving a new trail of destruction and death, inflicting a direct hit first on Dominica and today on its neighbour Puerto Rico, causing great destruction and damage.\\nWe take this opportunity to express our solidarity with Puerto Rico, which is also our neighbour, as well as with all the countries affected. The people of the Dominican Republic offer their deepest sympathy for the destruction and the large numbers of victims. Accurate figures for the damage done on Saint Barthélemy, Saint Maarten, Anguilla, the Virgin Islands, Tortola, Turks and Caicos, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and especially Florida and Cuba, have yet to be determined. However, we can say that they have suffered substantial damage, that recovery will take years and that, tragically, valuable lives have been lost.\\nTo give Member States an idea of how severely we have been affected, despite the lack of definitive figures, I can say that the material losses caused by this hurricane season alone far exceed the gross domestic product of the Dominican Repub...   \n",

       "46  Mr. BALAGUER said that it was the first time that the General Assembly of the United Nations had met on the soil of France, the mother of liberty and the cradle of human rights. If the atmosphere of the world were at present less charged with anxiety and if the shadow of a fresh catastrophe did not darken the future of humanity, it would have been said that that change of headquarters, apart from whatever other motives involved, fulfilled a purpose of incalculable moral value. The three regular sessions of the Assembly of the United Nations had been held in the three countries of the world which most strongly represented the principles of political freedom and of respect for individual rights. The United Nations Organization, born in San Francisco, had been initiated in London; it had drawn its first breath in England, as though it had been desired that the representatives of all the nations should strengthen their faith in the renewal of liberty by the splendid sight of a famous people which had just arisen from the ruins of war, as a symbol of the indestructibility of the human spirit and as a symbol of justice and right — values which would never die, however persecuted.\\nThe General Assembly had then moved to the United States of America, the most powerful democracy on earth and the home of the people which had decided the issue of the tremendous conflict by throwing into the balance the most formidable fighting machine that the world had ever seen.\\nThe capital of France, the country which, with the Encyclopedists, had seen the birth of the loftiest ideals of modern political thought, now welcomed the United Nations. France, a great country, which was the pride of Latin culture, would by its history give the moral impulse required to overcome the feelings of distrust and pessimism which were beginning to undermine the foundations of the United Nations as in its last days they had those of the League of Nations.\\nThe Dominican Republic, heir, like all the La...   \n",

Questions like the international control of atomic energy or the reduction and limitation of armaments could be solved provided we first reach general agreement on the manner in which peace is to be maintained and strengthened. We should also be on the way to finding practical and useful solutions for problems like those connected with the threats to the political independence and territorial integrity of certain Members of this world Organization. If we attain agreement on methods, we shall have gone halfway towards putting them into effect.\\n121.\\tI therefore attach the utmost importance to the item arising out of the report of the Collective Measures Committee, for, if we were to succeed in taking a unanimous decision on it we should be able, sooner or later, to solve all the other political problems before us.\\n122.\\tNevertheless, the prospect before us is not encouraging. From the very first meeting of this session the sharp division of opinion on political problems has made itself felt. At earlier sessions, as we set to work, we were hopeful of reaching practical results in the political sphere and it was only as the days went by that the deep divergence of views became apparent, postponing the adoption of a concerted plan for peace and security.

This year, that commitment was renewed when we assumed a non-permanent seat on its Security Council for the first time, despite being founders of the United Nations. That is, of course, a responsibility that honours and binds us. That is why, we have done our utmost since January to ensure that our contribution to the Council always involves the search for broad consensus, which facilitates decision-making and efficiency.\\nAs part of that work, at the beginning of the year, when we assumed the presidency, we organized an open debate on the impacts of climate-related disasters and their negative effects on international peace and security (see S/PV.8451). That debate takes on new meaning in the current context, following the wave of fires in the Amazon and the recent passage of Hurricane Dorian, which left behind a trail of shocking damage and many victims.\\nIt should be noted that for us and our Caribbean region, the effects of climate change are real, visible and devastating, and threaten the very existence of our countries. In that regard, we are encouraged by the fact that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres convened the Climate Action Summit to address climate action within the broader framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which we were very honoured to attend.

We are sure it will make a positive contribution towards the building of a better world, a task to which we are all committed.\\n56.\\tThe history of the Dominican Republic has been characterized by heroic deeds in the defence of liberty. In this difficult task, this is part of the contribution that American independence has made to the principles of democracy. Up to now we have been guided by and have followed those guidelines.\\n57.\\tWe cannot say that after 1844, when the Dominican Republic came into being as a free and independent State through the brave actions of a few, we have not had to rise up again because of the interference to which our national sovereignty was subjected. To these incidents must be added the fact of our political turbulence, which generated the implacable scourge of internal revolutions. Nevertheless, th...   \n",
       "67  I begin my statement by conveying the apologies of our President, Mr. Luis Abinader Corona, who, for unexpected reasons resulting from Hurricane Fiona, which has severely affected several provinces of our country, was unable to participate in this important general debate.\\nI cannot continue without first expressing our condolences to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as to the members and observers of the Commonwealth of Nations, on the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Her example of dedication to public service will be remembered forever.\\nAfter a painful period, which left millions of victims, we are once again in this great setting, since, thanks to science, we have managed to overcome the worst effects of the coronavirus disease. But who would have foreseen that, in the twenty-first century, the spectre of war would once again haunt Europe? It has been a severe test, and we will hopefully learn lessons that better prepare us for the challenges ahead.\\nThose would be preventable situations if there were the will to work together to find answers to the pressing problems facing humankind. That should be clear to us by now because, in a globalized world, there are no borders when it comes to the effects of epidemics, conflicts and violence. Precisely because ours is such an intertwined world, far-reaching goals always require “transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, as the theme of this session of the General Assembly aptly puts it.\\nIt is essential to recognize that this Organization needs major reforms to shake it out of the comfort in which it has been operating. It must be stressed that what is important to our countries is to consolidate a renewed multilateralism. As part of a substantive reform, the General Assembly must be given greater powers and participation in order to reduce the excessive use of the veto in the Security Council, especially when it comes to issues involving human rights violatio...   \n",

       "69   Permit me to begin. Sir, by taking this opportunity to convey to \\nyou the congratulations of the delegation of the Dominican Republic on your \\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh \\nsession. Coming from a region that is taking on a new dimension in the \\ninternational community, you will no doubt take a realistic view of the major \\nchallenges posed by the world situation. You have first-hand experience of \\nthe transformations taking place in the world. You are thus superbly \\nqualified to guide with composure the deliberations of the Assembly. \\nWe wish also to pay a warm tribute to the distinguished Saudi diplomat. \\nHis Excellency Mr. Samir S. Shihabi, the outgoing President, for his skill and \\nfor the fruitful results he achieved in his work. \\nOn the new international landscape, with the dissolution of the Soviet \\nUnion and the collapse of communism, the likelihood of a world war has \\nvanished. But in many regions it remains possible that conflicts of an \\nunpredictable nature could take place. \\nHence the international community should remain vigilant, because though \\nit is true that the danger of nuclear war has disappeared, it is no less true \\nthat another menace is still with us, that of the continued quest, on the part \\nof some countries, for technology for the production of nuclear weaponry, \\nbehind the back of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Agency \\ndeserves to be revitalized so that it will be able to work effectively in its \\nefforts to prevent the proliferation of those terrible weapons. \\nMankind is still burdened with problems arising out of the so-called \\nconventional weapons, which are becoming more and more destructive, and what \\nis needed is a degree of international control to limit them. That would make \\navailable resources that, if properly used, could contribute to the \\ndevelopment of the countries of the third world, which are already suffering \\nbecause of heavy public debt...   \n",
       "70  It \\nis an honour to participate in the sixty-ninth session \\nof the General Assembly of the United Nations by \\nrepresenting the people and the Government of the \\nDominican Republic. I wish to express my sincere \\ncongratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as \\nPresident at the current session. I wish to thank the \\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the honour \\nbestowed on our country by inviting us to participate \\nin the Education First initiative. As I hope that he \\nwas able to note in his recent visit to our country, the \\npriority that education is being given in the Dominican \\nRepublic is perhaps the best indicator of the new hopes \\nspringing up in our country. It is true that news of hope \\nis especially valuable these days when it is not very \\nabundant.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, the times we live in \\nraise major challenges for the mission of the \\nOrganization — preserving peace, encouraging \\ndevelopment, making education and health the \\nentitlement of all inhabitants of the Earth. As we are \\nall aware, about six years ago, a crisis that began in \\nthe financial sector of developed countries quickly \\nspread to all productive sectors and has affected the \\nentire planet.

       "0   Had the United Nations not been faced in its five years of existence with countless obstacles, had it not been called upon to deal with so many alarming symptoms in the historical development of a convalescent world, it would be difficult to justify its creation, to welcome its birth and to hang on it, as men hoist a banner to a masthead, the hopes of peace and security of a profoundly disturbed epoch. The fact is that the struggle which this young yet already sorely tried Organization has waged, and is still waging, is the best proof of the timeliness of its conception and creation, and of the urgent and imperious need for the work it is doing today.Certainly this has not been merely another episode in the political history of the peoples. The recent wars, with their unparalleled violence and enormous destructive power, engendered in the peoples a boundless desire for peace, concord and agreement. That is why the United Nations (united for agreement, concord and peace) neither can nor should be regarded as one of those familiar panaceas created for interested motives in international political laboratories with the object of providing temporary compromise solutions for more or less selfish problems; it must be recognized for what it is, a sacred idea conceived by the peoples at a time of grave and legitimate struggle for the permanent protection of their democratic existence, autonomy, dignity, peace and security.For these reasons it is a crime to obstruct it in its sacred mission. It is a crime to try to reduce it to a tool of selfish ideologies. It is a crime to use it as an instrument of war in times of peace. It is a crime not to render it due honour.“We the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war…” Thus reads the opening sentence of the Preamble of the United Nations Charter. Yet, today one of these nations, “determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” is violated and invaded b...  \n",
       "1   At the outset, I would like to congratulate Ambassador María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on her election as President of the General Assembly and to wish her every possible success. It is a great honour for me to be able to once again address the Assembly as President of the Dominican Republic. This is a special occasion for our country, because next year the Dominican Republic will sit on the Security Council as a nonpermanent member for the first time.On behalf of  the Dominican people and myself,    I would therefore like to start by thanking the States Members of the United Nations for the support we have received in joining the Security Council. In particular, I thank the members of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States for the trust placed in us. Our purpose during our term will be to contribute a voice for Latin America and the Caribbean to one of the forums for greater  global responsibility  in   the   maintenance of peace.Of course, we are committed to asserting, both in the Security Council and in the Assembly, the same unbreakable principles that guide us as a nation. Respect for human rights, democracy, freedom and diversity will therefore be the beacon that we will follow in order to guide our work in the Security Council. We will do everything possible to honour the trust placed in us, being fully aware that, although fragile, stability and security are priority objectives that must be preserved and progress made towards, step by step and day by day.It is clear to us that in a space that addresses issues that can change the course of history and the fate of millions of people, we cannot seek easy and drastic solutions, which in any case do not exist. In that context, our country will always be a place of dialogue and understanding, and will always seek peaceful solutions. We are always willing to do whatever it takes to find common ground and support consensus as the best tool for peace and development. We will therefore always promote rap...  \n",
       "2        May I begin my speech, Mr. President, by conveying to you on behalf of the delegation of the Dominican Republic our heartiest congratulations on your election to preside over the deliberations of this twentyfirst session of the General Assembly.    These sentiments also express our conviction that you will guide our labours so wisely yet so firmly that we can even now anticipate the chorus of praise and recognition from the delegations here present at the success of your noble efforts, in the high position you occupy by the vote of this Assembly, to achieve peace and the solution of the problems facing us.    It is not with empty words of vainglory or boasting, but backed by the exact not to say strict expression of historical truth, that I state that never in the history of the United Nations has there appeared before a meeting of the General Assembly a delegation of the Dominican Republic possessing credentials of such remarkable political value as those displayed by the delegation which I have the honour to lead.    Born out of elections in which the Dominican people gave vigorous and unequivocal support to the programme of the victorious party in a contest whose legality and fairness were vouched for by impartial observers representing various trends of contemporary political and social thought, the Government of Mr. Joaquin Balaguer, which I have the honour to represent at this rostrum, embodies in the most positive manner the people aspirations for justice and progress and guarantees my country complete identification with the United Nation profession of faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person.    As a fortunate result of representations made by the Dominican Republic in the Organization of American States, the InterAmerican Peace Force, stationed in my country as a sequel to the painful events which filled the Republic with grief and ruin, was withdrawn. My Government then approached the SecretaryGeneral of ...  \n",
       "3   Mr. President, before beginning my statement on behalf of the delegation of the Dominican Republic I should like to express in this General Assembly the great sorrow which overwhelms the Government and people of the Dominican Republic at the tragedy which our sister Republic of Honduras is living through. Honduras which; in this period of its history, is making extraordinary efforts to achieve progress on the road towards development, at this time suddenly has to face the violent forces of destiny. There has been practically total destruction as though an apocalyptic hand wanted to plunge it into despair.

       "5    At the close of the seventh session of the General Assembly, all the peoples devoted to international order, freedom and prosperity felt a deep satisfaction based on the heartfelt hope that, with the signing of the armistice at Panmunjom and the tangible results achieved there, there had been ensured not only, the final cessation of hostilities in the martyred land of Korea but also the initiation and success of negotiations that would lead to the speedy restoration of peace in that country, which had suffered premeditated aggression at the hands of governments whose goal was world domination by violence and hatred, in full accordance with the baneful purposes of international communism.For the vast majority of the member States of the international community, and especially for the small countries like the Dominican Republic, the success of the action undertaken and sustained by the initiative and under the auspices of the United Nations in defence of right and justice has shown, at the cost of' indescribable suffering and sacrifice, the urgent need for organizing and putting into effect a powerful system of defence of the international community, based on the requirements of collective security.If it is possible to single out, among the essential purposes of the United Nations Charter, one that can be considered as most important, it is that which requires that the moral force of justice should be constantly strengthened by the categorical and effective warning that the days when might was right have gone forever. Thus the United Nations is based on the outright condemnation of aggression and violence, and on due submission to the principles and rules under which the life of the international community is organized and developed. The Charter is, in short, the triumphant proclamation of the values of the spirit as against the schemings of force and materialism which bring in their train destruction, poverty, suffering and death.It is, then, in no way surprisin...  \n",
       "6   We convey our warmest congratulations to the renowned Libyan diplomat Mr. Ali Treki on his recent election to preside over the General Assembly at this sixtyfourth session, as well as for his call for a dialogue among civilizations, for interreligious understanding, for the promotion for peace and security and for closing the divide between rich and poor.  Exactly one year ago, when we were taking stock of progress made towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals at the midterm point, something unexpected occurred: the collapse of some of the most emblematic investment banks, and with that the worsening of the global financial crisis.   Before this crisis occurred, however, the world, in particular the developing countries, was already affected by the impact of two other crises that had begun simultaneously: the crisis involving oil prices and that involving food prices.  As a result of the first of these crises, that is, the oil crisis, vigorous and intense social protest broke out in various parts of the world. Suddenly, all products became more expensive. Governments were forced to use their currency reserves to pay their oil bills and were forced to allocate subsidies for the sake of maintaining civic peace and democratic governance.   When it comes to the second crisis, the food crisis, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations established that as a result of the food crisis, the number of people suffering from hunger worldwide rose by million, which meant that for the first time in human history the total figure exceeded the number of billion human beings.   Before these two crises broke out, the World Bank had already indicated that in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals in the remaining seven years — that is, between and — $billion were still needed, or $billion every year. Obviously, with the outbreak of these crises, which gravely affected the economies of developing countries, the resources needed to meet the objectiv...  \n",
       "7   ﻿The Dominican Republic wasamong the countries that founded the United Nations. Butthis is only the third time, in years, that its Head ofState has come to address the General Assembly. Perhapsthe reason for this noticeable absence of our country duringthe many years that this great annual event has been heldis that following the Second World War, the internationalsystem revolved around superPower rivalry, giving rise tothe cold war. In context, it is probable that our leaders feltthat their presence here would have been merely symbolic,with no real importance.That this may have been the case in the past, but theworld has changed. From the dramatic transformations inthe geopolitical environment, a multipolar internationalsystem has emerged, in which the economy matters morethan ideologies and military conflicts. This reorganizationof the international system on the basis of strategiceconomic objectives has been accompanied by a scientificand technological revolution, a revolution of knowledge thatspread across the planet and brought about the mostprofound change ever experienced in the history ofhumankind, turning the world into one large neighbourhood.In the new international order that arose following thecold war, the Dominican Republic could not remainisolated. That is why we are here today: to proclaim to theworld that the Dominican Republic is now actively joiningthe group of nations represented in this multilateralOrganization, so that, through international contacts andexchange, it can contribute to forging a better future forhumanity and, accordingly, a more promising future forDominicans.To ensure our participation in the various forums ofthe United Nations forums, exercising all the rights thathave been bestowed upon us, we proceeded, first, to payour financial debts in full.

That sociological concept applies to the successive periods of the history of civilization.In the world of today we are witnessing technological and scientific progress of such dimensions that we could almost say that it has outstripped man fantasy, which has always been governed by his tremendous imagination. Thus we have come today to the invention of destructive weapons which could wipe out the human race; and, similarly, with the arrival of man on the moon we can say that we have entered upon the stage of the domination of outer space.Today, almost everyone concedes that at this juncture in civilization, material progress, spurred by science, has changed the characteristics of a natural process in man that is to say, the structure of the individual and collective mentality.It would be difficult to forecast how far nations can be carried by the undeniable, realistic postulate which suggests the existence of an inverse ratio between material progress and moral progress in society today.From those considerations we could reach the view, which has been repeated since ancient times, that truly man is his own worst enemy. Hence the idea of domination at the cost of destruction and war has still not disappeared.The work done by the United Nations to achieve peace and eliminate the scourge of war, the events that have occurred and the actions that have been taken from the San Francisco Conference to the present day to avoid the spread...  \n",

At the outset, I would like to welcome and congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session.This anniversary gives us the opportunity to put in perspective what the Organization has meant for humankind. It was established years ago as the fruit of the worst horrors of war and as the first global forum created to preserve peace, coexistence and the well being of all human beings. It is true that the United Nations was born of the wounds, pain and fear left by the great conflicts of the twentieth century, but it also arose from the unstoppable force of hope and the iron will of great men and women who believed in dialogue, solidarity and the grandeur of the human race.Although we still have far to go and although immense challenges remain, the Organization continues to represent the values that inspire us day\n",

Also permit us to extend, on behalf of the Government of the Dominican Republic, our congratulations and thanks to the General Committee of our Assembly over which you preside for the spontaneous initiative, which does it credit, of including item in the agenda of this thirtyfourth session of the General Assembly. This item relates to measures for providing assistance to my country and to the Commonwealth of Dominica, a small country which, like our own, was cruelly battered by the fury of the hurricanes of this season of cyclones in the Caribbean.We must admit that this, too, represents a contribution to the peace for which the United Nations is fighting so heroically, a contribution which takes into account in circumstances like these, not only the scourge of war, but also the destructive force of nature. This tragedy, which afflicts the peoples suffering from the results of the hurricanes, inevitably gives rise not only to hunger and destruction, but also to all the upsetting results produced when economies are disrupted and when human suffering reaches such depths that it bears comparison with what happens when war, an apocalyptic figure bent upon uprooting the constitutional instrument of the United Nations, is unleashed.Our country was the victim in less than five days of two cruel hurricanes which spread tragedy, horror and chaos among its inhabitants, who were hoping for a future of peace and labour in a climate of democracy, and when the Dominican Government had already set up action programmes for the economic development of the nation and had been mobilizing all the forces of production, in many scientifically new and revolutionary areas, in order to make the best use of all the re...  \n",

The outstanding qualities of the new President have become manifest during the years in which he has served with distinction and brilliance as representative of his country in this world Organization and in other diplomatic posts.His tact, moderation, sound judgement, conscientiousness and legal abilities augur well that the problems facing the United Nations will be approached and considered in the way that will most benefit mankind now and in the future.The Dominican people, as a member of the family of American nations, are glad that a representative of our group will serve as President of this General Assembly and, even more so, that he is a worthy representative of the country of Bolívar.

This fact should, however, only spur it on to greater efforts for the benefit of mankind.A few hours after the treacherous attack on Pearl Harbor, the Dominican Republic, honouring its tradition of law and its international engagements, resolutely went to war to show its solidarity with, and to share the fortunes of, the victim of that hateful aggression, thus taking part at its side in the hazards and responsibilities of the struggle for the defence of freedom of the peoples, and of human dignity. In conformity with this attitude, on the historic occasion of the third meeting of Foreign Ministers in Rio de Janeiro, we championed a joint declaration of war by all the American nations against the totalitarian powers. For the sake of continental solidarity, we supported the agreements there adopted, although they were in fact less radical than the position taken up and the views maintained by the people and Government of the Dominican Republic.As soon as victory began to dawn on the horizon, victory won at the price of such cruel sacrifices, we devoted all our energies to securing effective collaboration in the efforts at San Francisco to produce a world organization worthy of the high destiny of mankind and of civilization.Once the proposal which brought the United Nations into bang had taken final shape, we placed all our reserves of faith and hope in it....  \n",

I wish to begin my remarks with a special recognition of the work of SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon. We appreciate his dedication in the search for solutions to the conflicts that have shaken the world over the past years, and we wish him the best of luck in the new tasks that he will undertake.The year is proving to be especially turbulent, with territorial conflicts and open identityrelated tensions in various parts of the world. We hope and insist, of course, that the international community will find a peaceful outcome to those conflicts — first and foremost for the sake of the millions of lives that are affected by them. Sometimes the urgency inherent in those tragedies weakens our commitment to address problems that appear to be less pressing but are the most important in the long term.One such issue, with perhaps the largest scope and greatest potential for longterm transformation, is the fight against poverty and inequality. Over the past two decades, the rapid economic growth brought about by economic globalization has fuelled high expectations in the countries of the South. In fact, it was believed that the prosperity enjoyed by a few countries might finally be within everyone’s reach. It should be recognized that those hopes were not unfounded. Indeed, over the course of those two decades, hundreds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty.But we cannot let ourselves be carried away by excessive optimism. We have an obligation to clarify the scope of those gains in the light of the actual data. We must also expand our horizons to observe those places and areas where globalization has not kept the promises made to humankind.To begin with, we must remember that all of the hundreds of millions of people who were recently lifted out of poverty did not automatically become part of the middle class, nor did all who were able to do so nece...  \n",

We would also like to take this opportunity to greet the members of the General Assembly.  During the four years following the Millennium Summit of  the Dominican Republic went through a crisis, during which our national currency was devalued by per cent. Our working class had to double its efforts simply to meet their basic subsistence needs. Drug trafficking and high levels of crime gained a foothold, and our credibility went down worldwide. According to the statistics of the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, more than million out of the million Dominicans sank into the lowest levels of poverty. At that time, we were facing one of the most dramatic crises in the modern history of the Dominican Republic.  Since we took the reins of administration in  the Dominican Republic has managed to recover the confidence of investors and entrepreneurs. We have been able to reactivate economic growth. We have been able to reduce inflation. We have increased jobs and improved social conditions and quality of life for the Dominican people.  However, exactly when we began, just like the phoenix rising from its own ashes, a gloomy international picture threatened to darken our prospects for future growth. In recent weeks, for example, the price of oil on the international market has reached an unprecedented rate, and projections point towards continued increases. These price increases are asphyxiating our economies.  Similarly, in recent times, as a result of changes on the international stage, free zone companies in the Dominican Republic, alongside those in Mexico and Central America, have been losing their competitive edge to Asian countries. ...  \n",

The fact is that the human and natural elements in our difficult task of reconciling various aspirations, ideals and interests are so prominent that we are at times dramatically made aware of our shortcomings, of obvious areas of disagreement and of lack of comprehension.How, then, can we achieve peace? That is the main concern of the delegation representing the Dominican Republic at this eleventh session of the General Assembly, which is attended by the largest number of Member States in its history — the old founder States, like our own, those which joined later, and the new Members which are to offer us their muchneeded cooperation, inasmuch as we agree that the universality of the United Nations, one of our longstanding hopes, is one of the main objectives of the Charter.Yet the task of achieving peace has its price and is beset with thorny problems. The price must be paid in respect of any human endeavour and the thorny problems will arise because no path is ever entirely smooth. The peace that we all long for and that would fulfil the yearning of millions of human beings throughout the world has implications and a meaning of considerable importance for the world today; it could be achieved through joint and sincere efforts if each, one of us were to act in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and develop his capabilities and if nations, like men, and States, like individuals, attained such a degree of social equilibrium and tolerance that they could discharge their domestic obligations without neglecting their foreign obligations and meet their international ...  \n",

In conferring on him such an outstanding honour, the Organisation has recognised his outstanding diplomatic work and his devotion to the cause of peace.He also wish to congratulate the President of the fortyfourth session, the Ambassador of Nigeria, Major General Joseph Garba, on the excellent work he did and on the wisdom and discretion with which he overcame innumerable obstacles.We reiterate our gratitude to the SecretaryGeneral, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, who has spared no efforts in the cause of world peace. He has even made several trips to that region of anguish the Middle East, and has established valuable personal contacts with the aim of finding a negotiated solution to the crisis that affects that region, in particular the Persian Gulf.We wish to place on record the great pleasure of the Dominican Republic at the admission of Namibia to the Organisation. That country should have taken its seat here long ago, but finally its admission has become a reality.It is with great pleasure that we associate ourselves with the expressions of solidarity made here following the admission of the State of Liechtenstein. It has been welcomed with much pleasure as a member of this family of nations, which has thus come nearer to universality.

Since then, I have not taken any personal part in the interesting debates of this distinguished international institution, and it is only indirectly, through the Foreign Ministry of my country, that I have been able to follow from a distance the difficult, complicated and laborious progress of this Organization, upon which humanity gazes with anxious and fearful faith.On returning to this solemn gathering, entering once again this great laboratory of international political thought, where noble and courageous ideas are struggling to make righteousness prevail, to ensure the certainty of moral and material peace, and to achieve lasting and permanent security, it is only natural that I should draw a comparison between the United Nations of yesterday — since everything that lives has its yesterday, its today and possibly its tomorrow — and the United Nations of today.We must all recognize the merits of the tremendous work which has been accomplished during the last five years by the United Nations. Its dynamic nature has proliferated in more and more activities; its indefatigable enterprise has created new agencies, its efforts have spread to ever wider horizons. For all these things this honourable institution deserves the gratitude and applause of the nations of the world; but activity, initiative and effort are all the more praiseworthy in proportion as they attain the goals which they set out to attain.The greatest brains of our time in the political, economic and scientific world have contributed the best of their Intelligence to bringing about the success of the immense project inaugurated by the Charter of the United Nations, which was signed in San Francisco a little more than ten years ago.

In the years since its inception, there has not been another world war, but today we are facing a cataclysm that is just as lethal and destructive as a war of planetary dimensions: global poverty.

In that text, Member States renewed their commitment to sustainable development and to the promotion of a future that is sustainable in economic, social and environmental terms for our planet and for present and future generations. That declaration shows that the leaders of the world’s nations are committed to doing what is needed to attain that future.

That decision was made on the basis of your wellknown personal and professional skills and experience in international affairs. These qualities will undoubtedly enable you to make a significant contribution to the success of our meetings.I take this opportunity to extend a cordial greeting to your predecessor, Mr. Choudhury of Bangladesh, and thank him for the competent and authoritative way in which he carried out the duties of President at the last session.On behalf of the Dominican Government, I also have pleasure in extending warm greetings to the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and assuring him of our appreciation and gratitude for his praiseworthy and valiant efforts in pursuing the purposes of our Organization.The maintenance of peace and respect for the principle of nonintervention are unalterable elements of the foreign policy of my country, as set forth in our fundamental law and supported by our practice in international relations.Negotiation and dialogue are for my country the ideal instruments for the achievement and maintenance of peace, both nationally and internationally. Without peace there can be no economic progress or social development.Peace is not merely the absence of war or peace imposed by a superior force. Peace imposed by fear, conditional upon a balance of destructive power, is despicable and transitory.

The General Assembly was meeting in an atmosphere of tranquillity under the leadership of a distinguished statesman, General Romulo, who could be described as the embodiment of the spirit of human kindness.The task before the Assembly was not easy, nothing was more arduous than the effort to reconcile conflicting ideologies and interests. Good will, however, had power akin to faith, which moved mountains.While the Assembly agenda covered a vast number of topics, the political items, which occasioned the great differences, were not as numerous as in the past; moreover, they had all been discussed previously.The question of the disposal of the former Italian colonies was of primary importance. Mr. Henriquez Ureña hoped the Assembly would find an equitable and workable solution of the problem during that session; the position of the Dominican Republic thereon had already been clearly indicated and it would remain unchanged. Any solution designed to ensure the preparation of those former colonies for selfgovernment or independence, through an orderly process carried out under the supervision of the United Nations, would have the support of the delegation of the Dominican Republic.The Dominican Republic maintained an equally firm attitude with regard to any problem involving respect for the independence and sovereignty of a State. For that reason it could not remain indifferent to another question which had already been debated in past sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, namely, the threat to the political independence and territorial integrity of Greece. Not only was the sacred principle of independence attacked by such threats but also another principle, that of nonintervention, which the American Republics had e...  \n",

In  the twentieth special session of the General Assembly was held to contribute to the elimination or substantial reduction of the illegal production of drugs and drug abuse by  Ten years later, at a followup review meeting supported by this prestigious world body, the conclusion was reached that little progress had been made regarding the proposed goals and that there were therefore plenty of reasons for the international community to be concerned about the growing threat posed by the global drug problem. It was determined that a new year plan was needed to cover the period until  when the General Assembly will have once again to convene Member States in order to assess the outcome of measures implemented to eliminate the most serious threat to our citizens’ safety at the dawn of the twentyfirst century: transnational organized crime and illegal drug trafficking.  Today, almost million people between the ages of and consume drugs worldwide. Although that consumption extends to many regions around the world, the highest concentration of users is found in areas with the most pronounced economic and social development, such as the United States, Western Europe and Central Asia.  Drug consumption is harmful to health, causing personality disorders that often lead to loss of will, apathy and the development of pathological behaviour. Furthermore, tens of thousands of people die every year as a direct result of drug consumption, while others, depending on the way these toxic substances are consumed, are affected by diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C.

This is demonstrated by our collaboration in the Organization’s collective security programmes and, more particularly, in those which are inspired by a genuine sense of human solidarity, such as the programmes concerned with refugees, child relief and technical assistance, to which we have contributed with a generosity and regularity which have already become proverbial.The interval between the twelfth and the thirteenth sessions of the General Assembly has been one of the most anxious times in the history of the United Nations, The ex...  \n",

In order to makethat victory a lasting one, and in order to ensure thathumankind would maintain a steady and clear pathtowards peace, the nations who fought for freedomrecognized the need to create a body to watch over thevalues that would improve international behaviour.These were the reasons for both the emergence of theUnited Nations and for enshrining in the Charter theobjectives of peace, justice, the rejection of aggressionand the resolution of controversies through peacefulmeans and in accordance with international law.In other words, it was very clearly set out that theOrganization would seek to use every peaceful meansto resolve conflicts between peoples or States.

At the outset, I would like to apologize on behalf of Mr. Danilo Madina Sánchez, President of the Dominican Republic, for his absence from the debate, as he has had to return to our country to deal with Hurricane Maria.Our meeting this week coincides with the devastating season of natural disasters that our region has been enduring for nearly a month with terrible consequences. The disasters have also spread to Mexico, which has been hit by two destructive earthquakes, and the southern United States, viciously punished by Hurricane Harvey. In the catalogue of human suffering caused by Hurricane Irma, that of Antigua and Barbuda stands out, particularly Barbuda, per cent of whose infrastructure has collapsed, according to its Prime Minister, Gaston Browne. Hardly had Irma’s devastating winds dropped than Maria arrived, leaving a new trail of destruction and death, inflicting a direct hit first on Dominica and today on its neighbour Puerto Rico, causing great destruction and damage.We take this opportunity to express our solidarity with Puerto Rico, which is also our neighbour, as well as with all the countries affected. The people of the Dominican Republic offer their deepest sympathy for the destruction and the large numbers of victims. Accurate figures for the damage done on Saint Barthélemy, Saint Maarten, Anguilla, the Virgin Islands, Tortola, Turks and Caicos, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and especially Florida and Cuba, have yet to be determined. However, we can say that they have suffered substantial damage, that recovery will take years and that, tragically, valuable lives have been lost.To give Member States an idea of how severely we have been affected, despite the lack of definitive figures, I can say that the material losses caused by this hurricane season alone far exceed the gross domestic product of the Dominican Republic.

The admission of these Members to the Organization is a further step on the way to decolonization, and the fact that when the Charter was signed in there were fiftyone Members, whereas today the original number has more than doubled, with African nations predominating among the new Members, shows how much progress has been made.The remarks of the Dominican Republic on this occasion and at this stage of the general debate will, in view of the present circumstances, necessarily be very brief and be confined to some aspects of the problems which most directly concern it within the framework of the United Nations.

It is hardly necessary for me to say that the United Nations must be preserved at all costs and regardless of the sacrifices involved and that we must all do our utmost to preserve it, since it is our common heritage built up over the centuries in an endeavour to find a formula enabling people to live together in peace and understanding.

The United Nations gained maturity after being subjected to the most cruel tests, which, far from having weakened its power as the chief instrument for saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war, have enabled it to rise afresh each time with the necessary vitality to safeguard and to proclaim with authority the pronouncements in the preamble and the guiding principles enshrined in the Charter. At the last session of the General Assembly, the delegation of the Dominican Republic appeared for the first time as the genuine representatives of a democratic State ruled by a constitutional Government elected by universal suffrage, after the vicissitudes that the principles on which the Republic had been based in had suffered for many years. The Government which I have the honour to represent at this rostrum not only bases its desires for justice and progress on the will of the people to survive and to work out an effective democracy on the lines of that defined in the Charter of Santiago de Chile, ...  \n",
       "45  ﻿On behalf of the Government of the Dominican Republic and of the delegation which I have the honour of leading, I wish to convey to Mr. Lusaka our most sincere congratulations on his election to preside over the work of the thirtyninth session of the General Assembly. This welldeserved distinction recognizes his role as a fighter for the cause of peace and the wellbeing of nations, his brilliant work as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia and his effective cooperation in the United Nations. His election augurs well for the balanced and fruitful conduct of this session. This wise choice is also an eloquent tribute to the country, Zambia, and to the entire African continent, which is characterized by its devotion to the quest for a fairer international social order.My delegation also pays a tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Jorge Illueca, for his efficient leadership of the deliberations of the General Assembly at the thirtyeighth session. His diplomatic skill won him the admiration of all and is a source of pride to the peoples of Latin America.I should also like to express our gratitude to the SecretaryGeneral for his perseverance in translating into reality the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for his invaluable contributions to the cause of progress and international peace and security.Allow me to extend a most cordial welcome to the new State of Brunei Darussalam, which recently won independence. Its efforts to realize the ideals of justice pursued by the United Nations will undoubtedly prove to be an asset to the Organization.The international situation, which grows more alarming each passing day, should be a matter of collective concern to all peaceloving nations and should, of necessity, lead them to strengthen the United Nations. This firm belief inspires me to reiterate the idea I put forward in my statement at the thirtyeighth session that:At this difficult time in the history of mankind, internation...  \n",
       "46  Mr. BALAGUER said that it was the first time that the General Assembly of the United Nations had met on the soil of France, the mother of liberty and the cradle of human rights. If the atmosphere of the world were at present less charged with anxiety and if the shadow of a fresh catastrophe did not darken the future of humanity, it would have been said that that change of headquarters, apart from whatever other motives involved, fulfilled a purpose of incalculable moral value. The three regular sessions of the Assembly of the United Nations had been held in the three countries of the world which most strongly represented the principles of political freedom and of respect for individual rights. The United Nations Organization, born in San Francisco, had been initiated in London; it had drawn its first breath in England, as though it had been desired that the representatives of all the nations should strengthen their faith in the renewal of liberty by the splendid sight of a famous people which had just arisen from the ruins of war, as a symbol of the indestructibility of the human spirit and as a symbol of justice and right — values which would never die, however persecuted.The General Assembly had then moved to the United States of America, the most powerful democracy on earth and the home of the people which had decided the issue of the tremendous conflict by throwing into the balance the most formidable fighting machine that the world had ever seen.The capital of France, the country which, with the Encyclopedists, had seen the birth of the loftiest ideals of modern political thought, now welcomed the United Nations. France, a great country, which was the pride of Latin culture, would by its history give the moral impulse required to overcome the feelings of distrust and pessimism which were beginning to undermine the foundations of the United Nations as in its last days they had those of the League of Nations.The Dominican Republic, heir, like all the Latin Am...  \n",
       "47  In the list of items proposed for the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly, one on which the Collective Measures Committee has made a very thorough report is particularly outstanding: “ Methods which might be used to maintain and strengthen international peace and security in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter ”.The inclusion of this item holds out ground for hope, because all, or almost all, the political items in the agenda might yield results, could we but attain unanimity of opinion and resolve upon the adoption of such methods. Questions like the international control of atomic energy or the reduction and limitation of armaments could be solved provided we first reach general agreement on the manner in which peace is to be maintained and strengthened. We should also be on the way to finding practical and useful solutions for problems like those connected with the threats to the political independence and territorial integrity of certain Members of this world Organization. If we attain agreement on methods, we shall have gone halfway towards putting them into effect.I therefore attach the utmost importance to the item arising out of the report of the Collective Measures Committee, for, if we were to succeed in taking a unanimous decision on it we should be able, sooner or later, to solve all the other political problems before us.Nevertheless, the prospect before us is not encouraging. From the very first meeting of this session the sharp division of opinion on political problems has made itself felt. At earlier sessions, as we set to work, we were hopeful of reaching practical results in the political sphere and it was only as the days went by that the deep divergence of views became apparent, postponing the adoption of a concerted plan for peace and security. Our initial feeling of optimism was replaced by discouragement and scepticism.I trust that on this occasion the reverse will be the case; I trust that the init...  \n",

We are certain that his privileged experience and his wisdom will facilitate the achievement of our common purpose in the search for just solutions as well as in the results of our deliberations. Let us then hope that, guided by the values he represents, we will be able to say at the end of our work that at this thirtyfirst session of the General Assembly considerable progress has been made and that we have been able to clear up the unknown factors that have held back progress toward a new policy of understanding and effective decisionmaking in the difficult task of fulfilling the mandate imposed by the expectations of our times under the Charter of our world Organization.I wish to convey the most heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the brilliant manner, the goodwill and competence with which he presided over the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.also wish to express the deep appreciation of my Government for the effective and vigorous work of Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, who has so faithfully served the principles of the Organization.

       "50  We extend our warmest congratulations to the Ambassador from Qatar, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz AlNasser, on his recent election as President of the General Assembly at its sixtysixth session. We welcome his intention to use this session to address pressing issues such as mediation and conflict resolution, the reform of the United Nations system, preventing and responding to natural disasters and sustainable development for global prosperity.  Ten years ago, the dynamic and vibrant city of New York was shocked by something previously inconceivable: the terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers. Thousands of innocent people died in horrific ways, leaving relatives and friends in a state of helplessness and sorrow. Echoes of that terror reverberated around the planet, leaving scars and a trail of pain to this day. The world has not been the same since then.  In the interest of security, even in strong democracies where genuine rule of law prevails, some individual liberties, previously considered sacred and immutable, have been sacrificed. While the ashes were still smouldering and the rubble of the Twin Towers still lay where it fell, the war in Afghanistan was launched, which, although perhaps justified as a case of legitimate defence, has nevertheless produced more victims than the terrorist attacks themselves. Then came the occupation of Iraq, which spurred controversy in various circles of international public opinion but in any case certainly generated more violence, produced new victims and new waves of human suffering and caused more destruction of wealth.  The lesson to be learned from these past years is that there must be a collective effort to eliminate terrorism as an inhuman practice, to eliminate as well the economic, social, political, cultural, ideological and religious factors that fuel it, and to promote a world that is more open, more tolerant, more respectful and more willing to engage in dialogue and in the recognition of human dignity.

We also take this opportunity to greet our fellow Member States in this General Assembly.   Eight years ago, in this same place, representatives of countries undertook a crucial commitment, possibly one of the most transcendental commitments that such a large number of nations ever made. They agreed on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In the year  it was believed — and this is still the case today — that the objectives established at that time would go down in the common history of humankind as the bravest ethical decision ever taken in the face of extreme poverty, the shame of generalized injustice and the heartbreaking tragedy of social inequity. It was an agenda of work and dedication that required a large dose of political will, actions laid out in conformity with the goals to be reached, a reorganization of budgetary priorities and a    greater flow of aid resources and support for development.   We did not undertake the Millennium Development Goals in vague terms. We did not couch the Millennium Declaration in abstract and grandiloquent concepts lacking in substance. Quite the contrary, we analysed with the greatest possible rigour the situation that we wanted to correct. We measured with mathematical precision its overwhelming scope and the magnitude of the political and financial effort that its reversal would require.   We committed to the MDGs with such supreme responsibility that we even set a date for their achievement: the year  Now we are halfway to that date, and we face the disheartening situation of an international landscape full of obstacles to overcome if we are to conclude what we set out to do in the year  We knew there would be difficulties. We recognized that we would have to overco...  \n",

The international community has expressed the hope that the year  in which we are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, will mark the beginning of an era of lasting peace and justice throughout the world, as well as one of social and economic development, progress and independence for all peoples of the world. In view of the great importance that the work of this session will have for the future of our organization, your election, Mr. President, could not have been wiser or more just. You possess not only a thorough knowledge of the work of the United Nations, acquired over a period of many years, but also a broad understanding of the role that the Organization should play in the creation of a better world. Moreover, your election is a recognition of the outstanding role played by Spain in the evolution of the world culture and the indisputable contribution it has made to the development of the norms and principles governing the conduct of nations in their mutual relations. It is also a significant demonstration of affection for the noble people of Spain, at present living through one of the glorious periods in its history as a result of its steadfast resolve to live under a system in which democracy and justice prevail. In the circumstances, this special session could not have begun under better auspices.I also wish to take this opportunity to pay a most sincere tribute to the magnificent job done by your predecessor, Ambassador Lusaka of Zambia, whose constant devotion to his work and faith in the organization future allowed him to bring to a successful conclusion all the activities connected with the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the united Nations.It also gives me great pleasure to mention the dedication and zeal with which the SecretaryGeneral, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, is carrying out his important tasks.

This year, that commitment was renewed when we assumed a nonpermanent seat on its Security Council for the first time, despite being founders of the United Nations. That is, of course, a responsibility that honours and binds us. That is why, we have done our utmost since January to ensure that our contribution to the Council always involves the search for broad consensus, which facilitates decisionmaking and efficiency.As part of that work, at the beginning of the year, when we assumed the presidency, we organized an open debate on the impacts of climaterelated disasters and their negative effects on international peace and security (see S/PV.. That debate takes on new meaning in the current context, following the wave of fires in the Amazon and the recent passage of Hurricane Dorian, which left behind a trail of shocking damage and many victims.It should be noted that for us and our Caribbean region, the effects of climate change are real, visible and devastating, and threaten the very existence of our countries. In that regard, we are encouraged by the fact that SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres convened the Climate Action Summit to address climate action within the broader framework of the Agenda for Sustainable Development, which we were very honoured to attend. We agree with him that climate change is the defining issue of our time and a direct existential threat.

If the United Nations is to achieve the purpose for which it was setup, namely to bring States together with a view to promoting peace and improving the conditions in which man lives, on the basis of a general concept that necessarily embraces the whole of mankind, it must cease to be the restrictive wartime coalition which it was at its inception and must steadily reduce the hazard and uncertainty surrounding the conception of the qualifications required of an existing political entity before it can become a Member State.Just as the exaggerated pressure of the different political ideologies which divide the world today invests some of the applications for admission to the Organization with an element of artificiality, so, too, the struggle for the principle of selfdetermination is being waged with varying success in the context of the atmosphere of conflict in which the fundamental purposes of the Charter are being achieved.Despite adverse circumstances in which the principle of universality is being debated, recent sessions of the Assembly indicate that in the long run the imperative requirements of international life will prevail over subjective interpretations of the...  \n",
       "65  I am greatly honoured to congratulate Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed AlKhalifa of Bahrain upon her election, the first woman from the Middle East, to preside over the work of the sixtyfirst session of the General Assembly. She has the great responsibility to promote dialogue and harmony in the midst of the spread of conflict throughout the world. Likewise, we wish to pay tribute to the SecretaryGeneral for his ten years at the head of this Organization and for his immense efforts to promote peacekeeping, security and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  In the interest of continuity in the pursuit of United Nations reform, so notably promoted by the SecretaryGeneral, our country wishes to reiterate its conviction that any reform must provide for greater democratization. We recognize the unquestionable accomplishments achieved during this process, such as the creation of the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. Notwithstanding, reform will be incomplete if it does not include reform of the Security Council, the body specifically responsible for taking political decisions within this Organization. It is our conviction that the Security Council must be expanded to make it more diverse and participatory, with the aim of ensuring more equitable regional representation and taking into account the regional and national interests that prevail in today’s world. There is also a need for closer cooperation between the Security Council and other important United Nations bodies, such as the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council.  One of the global issues of great concern to the Dominican Republic and other parts of the world is that of human security. We have observed with great consternation that there has recently been an erosion of domestic security in countries, leading to increased violence and criminality. That situation has, without a doubt, been fuelled by a combination of factors, among them drug trafficking, the illicit...  \n",
       "66  ﻿Mr. President, permit me first to express to you the congratulations of our delegation since the General Assembly has with discernment elected you to preside over this session, whose agenda includes subjects for study and decision that are of much importance for the States which make up the United Nations. We are certain that your wisdom and your experience will mean that our common endeavour will prevail, both in the search for just solutions and in the results to which our deliberations lead. It is therefore our hope that, guided by the values you represent, we shall be able, when our work is done, to say that the thirtythird session of the General Assembly made substantial progress and was able to dispel the intangible factors that have halted the advance towards a new policy of understanding and effective decisions in the difficult task imposed on us by the expectations of our times and by the United Nations Charter. We wish to avail ourselves of this opportunity to extend our most cordial congratulations to Solomon Islands on its becoming a Member of this Organization. We are sure it will make a positive contribution towards the building of a better world, a task to which we are all committed.The history of the Dominican Republic has been characterized by heroic deeds in the defence of liberty. In this difficult task, this is part of the contribution that American independence has made to the principles of democracy. Up to now we have been guided by and have followed those guidelines.We cannot say that after  when the Dominican Republic came into being as a free and independent State through the brave actions of a few, we have not had to rise up again because of the interference to which our national sovereignty was subjected. To these incidents must be added the fact of our political turbulence, which generated the implacable scourge of internal revolutions. Nevertheless, the ideals upheld with sacrifice and selflessness by the founders of the Republic re...  \n",
       "67  I begin my statement by conveying the apologies of our President, Mr. Luis Abinader Corona, who, for unexpected reasons resulting from Hurricane Fiona, which has severely affected several provinces of our country, was unable to participate in this important general debate.I cannot continue without first expressing our condolences to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as to the members and observers of the Commonwealth of Nations, on the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Her example of dedication to public service will be remembered forever.After a painful period, which left millions of victims, we are once again in this great setting, since, thanks to science, we have managed to overcome the worst effects of the coronavirus disease. But who would have foreseen that, in the twentyfirst century, the spectre of war would once again haunt Europe? It has been a severe test, and we will hopefully learn lessons that better prepare us for the challenges ahead.Those would be preventable situations if there were the will to work together to find answers to the pressing problems facing humankind. That should be clear to us by now because, in a globalized world, there are no borders when it comes to the effects of epidemics, conflicts and violence. Precisely because ours is such an intertwined world, farreaching goals always require “transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, as the theme of this session of the General Assembly aptly puts it.It is essential to recognize that this Organization needs major reforms to shake it out of the comfort in which it has been operating. It must be stressed that what is important to our countries is to consolidate a renewed multilateralism. As part of a substantive reform, the General Assembly must be given greater powers and participation in order to reduce the excessive use of the veto in the Security Council, especially when it comes to issues involving human rights violations and sup...  \n",
       "68  It is a particularhonour for me to address the Assembly on behalf of theGovernment and people of the Dominican Republic and totake this opportunity to express my warmest congratulationsto you, Sir, on your recent election as President of the fiftyfourth session of the General Assembly.I would also like to commend the excellent work ofthat outstanding representative of our region, the ForeignMinister of Uruguay, Mr. Didier Opertti, who so efficientlyconducted the proceedings of the fiftythird session of theGeneral Assembly.Let me also wish Mr. Kofi Annan every success inthe important and delicate tasks he is carrying out asSecretaryGeneral of the United Nations.This venerable institution, the United Nations, wasfounded more than half a century ago with the lofty goalof safeguarding peace among nations and the integrity ofpeoples. The United Nations has made a significantcontribution to preventing armed conflict, reducingtension, resolving differences, promoting negotiation andagreements, and encouraging tolerance and nonviolence.But in a world that is becoming increasinglycomplex in the wake of an era marked by bipolarconfrontation between two models of civilization, andwith the rise of a technological revolution that hascontributed to an accelerated sense of time, a reduction indistances and an increase in expectations, the UnitedNations must exercise renewed leadership in order toconfront this new set of circumstances which, while theyrepresent tremendous opportunities for the peoples of theworld, may also threaten their future.It is no longer just a matter of preventing war andconflict; that unavoidable task will always be expected ofthe Organization. The United Nations must ensure forevery human being on this earth a dignified, hopeful anddecent existence.Never before has the world accumulated so muchwealth. At no other time in history has humankind beenable, as it is today, to produce everything it needs in theway of food, clothing, shelter, communications a...  \n",
       "69   Permit me to begin. Sir, by taking this opportunity to convey to you the congratulations of the delegation of the Dominican Republic on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fortyseventh session. Coming from a region that is taking on a new dimension in the international community, you will no doubt take a realistic view of the major challenges posed by the world situation. You have firsthand experience of the transformations taking place in the world. You are thus superbly qualified to guide with composure the deliberations of the Assembly. We wish also to pay a warm tribute to the distinguished Saudi diplomat. His Excellency Mr. Samir S. Shihabi, the outgoing President, for his skill and for the fruitful results he achieved in his work. On the new international landscape, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the collapse of communism, the likelihood of a world war has vanished. But in many regions it remains possible that conflicts of an unpredictable nature could take place. Hence the international community should remain vigilant, because though it is true that the danger of nuclear war has disappeared, it is no less true that another menace is still with us, that of the continued quest, on the part of some countries, for technology for the production of nuclear weaponry, behind the back of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Agency deserves to be revitalized so that it will be able to work effectively in its efforts to prevent the proliferation of those terrible weapons. Mankind is still burdened with problems arising out of the socalled conventional weapons, which are becoming more and more destructive, and what is needed is a degree of international control to limit them. That would make available resources that, if properly used, could contribute to the development of the countries of the third world, which are already suffering because of heavy public debt and restrictive and protectionist measures impeding inte...  \n",
       "70  It is an honour to participate in the sixtyninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations by representing the people and the Government of the Dominican Republic. I wish to express my sincere congratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President at the current session. I wish to thank the SecretaryGeneral, Mr. Ban Kimoon, for the honour bestowed on our country by inviting us to participate in the Education First initiative. As I hope that he was able to note in his recent visit to our country, the priority that education is being given in the Dominican Republic is perhaps the best indicator of the new hopes springing up in our country. It is true that news of hope is especially valuable these days when it is not very abundant.Generally speaking, the times we live in raise major challenges for the mission of the Organization — preserving peace, encouraging development, making education and health the entitlement of all inhabitants of the Earth. As we are all aware, about six years ago, a crisis that began in the financial sector of developed countries quickly spread to all productive sectors and has affected the entire planet. The consequences of the economic shock continue to be felt and were translated into tens of millions of unemployed, millions of evictions and deep cuts in social benefits in our countries.The welfare State, the instrument which produced some of the greatest advances in development and security in history, was jeopardized. Today, we live the paradox of seeing how that ideal of sustainable growth and social justice becomes more fragile in the countries of origin, while it is being reborn in emerging countries. While developed countries adopt policies of austerity and structural adjustments, which are concepts sadly familiar to Latin Americans, we see how social programmes proliferate in different corners of the planet, lifting millions out of poverty and mitigating inequality.In the Dominican Republic, we still have a lo...

       "0   Had the United Nations not been faced in its five years of existence with countless obstacles, had it not been called upon to deal with so many alarming symptoms in the historical development of a convalescent world, it would be difficult to justify its creation, to welcome its birth and to hang on it, as men hoist a banner to a masthead, the hopes of peace and security of a profoundly disturbed epoch. The fact is that the struggle which this young yet already sorely tried Organization has waged, and is still waging, is the best proof of the timeliness of its conception and creation, and of the urgent and imperious need for the work it is doing today.\\n2.\\tCertainly this has not been merely another episode in the political history of the peoples. The recent wars, with their unparalleled violence and enormous destructive power, engendered in the peoples a boundless desire for peace, concord and agreement. That is why the United Nations (united for agreement, concord and peace) neither can nor should be regarded as one of those familiar panaceas created for interested motives in international political laboratories with the object of providing temporary compromise solutions for more or less selfish problems; it must be recognized for what it is, a sacred idea conceived by the peoples at a time of grave and legitimate struggle for the permanent protection of their democratic existence, autonomy, dignity, peace and security.\\n3.\\tFor these reasons it is a crime to obstruct it in its sacred mission. It is a crime to try to reduce it to a tool of selfish ideologies. It is a crime to use it as an instrument of war in times of peace. It is a crime not to render it due honour.\\n4.\\t“We the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war…” Thus reads the opening sentence of the Preamble of the United Nations Charter. Yet, today one of these nations, “determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” is viol...   \n",
       "1   At the outset, I would like to congratulate Ambassador María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on her election as President of the General Assembly and to wish her every possible success. It is a great honour for me to be able to once again address the Assembly as President of the Dominican Republic. This is a special occasion for our country, because next year the Dominican Republic will sit on the Security Council as a non-permanent member for the first time.\\nOn behalf of  the Dominican people and myself,    I would therefore like to start by thanking the States Members of the United Nations for the support we have received in joining the Security Council. In particular, I thank the members of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States for the trust placed in us. Our purpose during our term will be to contribute a voice for Latin America and the Caribbean to one of the forums for greater  global responsibility  in   the   maintenance of peace.\\nOf course, we are committed to asserting, both in the Security Council and in the Assembly, the same unbreakable principles that guide us as a nation. Respect for human rights, democracy, freedom and diversity will therefore be the beacon that we will follow in order to guide our work in the Security Council. We will do everything possible to honour the trust placed in us, being fully aware that, although fragile, stability and security are priority objectives that must be preserved and progress made towards, step by step and day by day.\\nIt is clear to us that in a space that addresses issues that can change the course of history and the fate of millions of people, we cannot seek easy and drastic solutions, which in any case do not exist. In that context, our country will always be a place of dialogue\\n \\nand understanding, and will always seek peaceful solutions. We are always willing to do whatever it takes to find common ground and support consensus as the best tool for peace and development. We will therefore always ...   \n",

Honduras which; in this period of its history, is making extraordinary efforts to achieve progress on the road towards development, at this time suddenly has to face the violent forces of destiny. There has been practically total destruction as though an apocalyptic hand wanted to plunge it into despair.

At the close of the seventh session of the General Assembly, all the peoples devoted to international order, freedom and prosperity felt a deep satisfaction based on the heartfelt hope that, with the signing of the armistice at Panmunjom and the tangible results achieved there, there had been ensured not only, the final cessation of hostilities in the martyred land of Korea but also the initiation and success of negotiations that would lead to the speedy restoration of peace in that country, which had suffered premeditated aggression at the hands of governments whose goal was world domination by violence and hatred, in full accordance with the baneful purposes of international communism.\\n2.\\tFor the vast majority of the member States of the international community, and especially for the small countries like the Dominican Republic, the success of the action undertaken and sustained by the initiative and under the auspices of the United Nations in defence of right and justice has shown, at the cost of' indescribable suffering and sacrifice, the urgent need for organizing and putting into effect a powerful system of defence of the international community, based on the requirements of collective security.\\n3.\\tIf it is possible to single out, among the essential purposes of the United Nations Charter, one that can be considered as most important, it is that which requires that the moral force of justice should be constantly strengthened by the categorical and effective warning that the days when might was right have gone forever. Thus the United Nations is based on the outright condemnation of aggression and violence, and on due submission to the principles and rules under which the life of the international community is organized and developed.

Our working class had to \\ndouble its efforts simply to meet their basic subsistence \\nneeds. Drug trafficking and high levels of crime gained \\na foothold, and our credibility went down worldwide. \\nAccording to the statistics of the World Bank, the \\nUnited Nations Development Programme and the \\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the \\nCaribbean, more than 1.5 million out of the 9 million \\nDominicans sank into the lowest levels of poverty. At \\nthat time, we were facing one of the most dramatic \\ncrises in the modern history of the Dominican \\nRepublic. \\n Since we took the reins of administration in 2004, \\nthe Dominican Republic has managed to recover the \\nconfidence of investors and entrepreneurs. We have \\nbeen able to reactivate economic growth. We have been \\nable to reduce inflation. We have increased jobs and \\nimproved social conditions and quality of life for the \\nDominican people. \\n However, exactly when we began, just like the \\nphoenix rising from its own ashes, a gloomy \\ninternational picture threatened to darken our prospects \\nfor future growth. In recent weeks, for example, the \\nprice of oil on the international market has reached an \\nunprecedented rate, and projections point towards \\ncontinued increases. These price increases are \\nasphyxiating our economies. \\n Similarly, in recent times, as a result of changes \\non the international stage, free zone companies in the \\nDominican Republic, alongside...   \n",
       "22  If we review the activities of the United Nations since the days of San Francisco, we realize that never before has mankind been so deeply concerned with the question of peace, this peace which we have not yet been able to achieve despite all our efforts and despite the material we have collected and examined in the hope of offering this great achievement to future generations. The fact is that the human and natural elements in our difficult task of reconciling various aspirations, ideals and interests are so prominent that we are at times dramatically made aware of our shortcomings, of obvious areas of disagreement and of lack of comprehension.\\n161.\\tHow, then, can we achieve peace? That is the main concern of the delegation representing the Dominican Republic at this eleventh session of the General Assembly, which is attended by the largest number of Member States in its history — the old founder States, like our own, those which joined later, and the new Members which are to offer us their much-needed cooperation, inasmuch as we agree that the universality of the United Nations, one of our long-standing hopes, is one of the main objectives of the Charter.\\n162.\\tYet the task of achieving peace has its price and is beset with thorny problems. The price must be paid in respect of any human endeavour and the thorny problems will arise because no path is ever entirely smooth. The peace that we all long for and that would fulfil the yearning of millions of human beings throughout the world has implications and a meaning of considerable importance for the world today; it could be achieved through joint and sincere efforts if each, one of us were to act in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and develop his capabilities and if nations, like men, and States, like individuals, attained such a degree of social equilibrium and tolerance that they could discharge their domestic obligations without neglecting their foreign obligations and meet th...   \n",

Mr. Henriquez Ureña hoped the Assembly would find an equitable and workable solution of the problem during that session; the position of the Dominican Republic thereon had already been clearly indicated and it would remain unchanged. Any solution designed to ensure the preparation of those former colonies for self-government or independence, through an orderly process carried out under the supervision of the United Nations, would have the support of the delegation of the Dominican Republic.\\n164.\\tThe Dominican Republic maintained an equally firm attitude with regard to any problem involving respect for the independence and sovereignty of a State.

This tribute would also be extended to the great Swedish nation, which has given this world Organization two martyrs: Count Bernadotte, who fell heroically in the deserts of the Middle East, and now Dag Hammarskjold, struck down by the same fatality which has pursued all redeemers since God Himself died on the cross to give us an example of the power of blood to inspire great causes and great human ideals.\\n4.\\tFor perhaps the first time in the history of the United Nations, a country of the Americas is re-entering this world Organization after having acquired the moral licence to belong to an institution founded precisely to defend the right of man to live in a world free from fear and injustice.

       "41  15.\\tI should like first to express my personal satisfaction and that of my delegation at the unanimous election of Mr. Belaúnde as President of this session of the General Assembly. His election not only recognizes his personal influence, which has been felt in the United Nations ever since it was founded at San Francisco, but is also well-deserved tribute to his country, which has contributed so greatly to the development of international law and culture in America and as such is a source of profound satisfaction to all the Latin American countries. Our ideals of peace and justice in international relations have found in Mr. Belaúnde, with his brilliant intelligence, his scholarship, backed by solid religious and moral convictions and his moving eloquence, an outstanding champion in each of the phases in the history of our Organization which he so admirably described in his speech of acceptance [795th meeting]. May I add my good wishes for the success of his work in the high office he now occupies.\\n16.\\tOnce again the General Assembly is meeting to review what has been achieved and to initiate new efforts in the cause of peace and collective security, the most serious and urgent problem of our time and the \"raison d’être\" of the United Nations.\\n17.\\tIn its exposition of the function of the main organs and in guiding principles of the United Nations, the Charter clearly established what might be described as the factors of peace and international security. The pacific settlement of international disputes, the development of respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, the control and ultimate elimination of the armaments race, the solution of problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, the promotion of social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom — these are the conditions that must be satisfied if we are to attain the goals to which mankind’s hopes for peace and security are directed....   \n",

The experience you have demonstrated in similar capacities in other United Nations organs and in other posts, and your ability, prudence and other qualities are undoubtedly an assurance of success in your present duties.\\n2.\\tMy delegation is also happy to welcome to this Organization the new States of Malawi, Malta and Zambia, which have come to take on and to share the heavy responsibilities imposed on all Members of the United Nations by its Charter. The admission of these Members to the Organization is a further step on the way to decolonization, and the fact that when the Charter was signed in 1945 there were fifty-one Members, whereas today the original number has more than doubled, with African nations predominating among the new Members, shows how much progress has been made.\\n3.\\tThe remarks of the Dominican Republic on this occasion and at this stage of the general debate will, in view of the present circumstances, necessarily be very brief and be confined to some aspects of the problems which most directly concern it within the framework of the United Nations. Before taking these up, however, we must express our hope and earnest wish that the difficulties. which the Organization is now facing may be dealt with in a realistic spirit and be satisfactorily overcome, so that its existence and authority may be reaffirmed and it may carry out the task assigned to it in the preamble of the Charter, for the good of mankind. It is hardly necessary for me to say that the United Nations must be preserved at all costs and regardless of the sacrifices involved and that we must all do our utmost to preserve it, since it is our common heritage built up over the centuries in an endeavour to find a formula enabling people to live together in peac...   \n",
       "43  In response to the unanimous sentiments of the people of the Dominican Republic, my Government comes for the seventh time to this General Assembly in order to give further evidence of its firm resolve to contribute unwaveringly and unconditionally by every means at its disposal to the efforts made by the United Nations in the difficult task of attempting through conciliation and agreement to find a just solution of the many problems and disputes that have been submitted to it for consideration and decision. These problems and disputes reflect the most varied aspects of the serious social and political crisis through which our generation is passing m these difficult times, and they confront the world with the terrible threat of war and destruction. Our participation in the noble work of the General Assembly is based, as always, upon an imperative desire for international co-operation. That we are able to realize that desire is the result of one of the most outstanding victories of contemporary civilization in the field of international law, namely, the final and complete recognition of the equal sovereignty of States, irrespective of their military strength or the extent of their territories.\\n49,\\tWe in the Dominican Republic are convinced that this fundamental principle of equality, which unites in this Assembly the community of the nations of the world on the basis of their common right to participate in the examination and discussion of problems and points of disagreement and, consequently, in the taking of decision designed to settle such matters, can and should be a sufficient stimulus to the creation and strengthening of an unshakeable faith that this eminent body can ensure a progressive implementation of the principles of international law and the supremacy of justice which will eventually make it possible for confidence and mutual respect to prevail in relations between States.

His election is a guarantee that this will be so, despite the magnitude of the task and the obstacles that will stand in the way of our efforts to find viable solutions to the problems on our agenda that will satisfy all the interests concerned and the aspirations that we all share.\\n\\n39. Under your skilful direction we must hope that all the difficulties, disagreements and misunderstandings that may arise during this session that is just starting will be helped by the moderating spirit and the harmonious goodwill that prevailed at the birth of our Organization at San Francisco. The United Nations gained maturity after being subjected to the most cruel tests, which, far from having weakened its power as the chief instrument for saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war, have enabled it to rise afresh each time with the necessary vitality to safeguard and to proclaim with authority the pronouncements in the preamble and the guiding principles enshrined in the Charter.\\n\\n40.

       "46  Mr. BALAGUER said that it was the first time that the General Assembly of the United Nations had met on the soil of France, the mother of liberty and the cradle of human rights. If the atmosphere of the world were at present less charged with anxiety and if the shadow of a fresh catastrophe did not darken the future of humanity, it would have been said that that change of headquarters, apart from whatever other motives involved, fulfilled a purpose of incalculable moral value. The three regular sessions of the Assembly of the United Nations had been held in the three countries of the world which most strongly represented the principles of political freedom and of respect for individual rights. The United Nations Organization, born in San Francisco, had been initiated in London; it had drawn its first breath in England, as though it had been desired that the representatives of all the nations should strengthen their faith in the renewal of liberty by the splendid sight of a famous people which had just arisen from the ruins of war, as a symbol of the indestructibility of the human spirit and as a symbol of justice and right — values which would never die, however persecuted.\\nThe General Assembly had then moved to the United States of America, the most powerful democracy on earth and the home of the people which had decided the issue of the tremendous conflict by throwing into the balance the most formidable fighting machine that the world had ever seen.\\nThe capital of France, the country which, with the Encyclopedists, had seen the birth of the loftiest ideals of modern political thought, now welcomed the United Nations. France, a great country, which was the pride of Latin culture, would by its history give the moral impulse required to overcome the feelings of distrust and pessimism which were beginning to undermine the foundations of the United Nations as in its last days they had those of the League of Nations.\\nThe Dominican Republic, heir, like all the La...   \n",
       "47  In the list of items proposed for the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly, one on which the Collective Measures Committee has made a very thorough report is particularly outstanding: “ Methods which might be used to maintain and strengthen international peace and security in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter ”.\\n120.\\tThe inclusion of this item holds out ground for hope, because all, or almost all, the political items in the agenda might yield results, could we but attain unanimity of opinion and resolve upon the adoption of such methods. Questions like the international control of atomic energy or the reduction and limitation of armaments could be solved provided we first reach general agreement on the manner in which peace is to be maintained and strengthened. We should also be on the way to finding practical and useful solutions for problems like those connected with the threats to the political independence and territorial integrity of certain Members of this world Organization. If we attain agreement on methods, we shall have gone halfway towards putting them into effect.\\n121.\\tI therefore attach the utmost importance to the item arising out of the report of the Collective Measures Committee, for, if we were to succeed in taking a unanimous decision on it we should be able, sooner or later, to solve all the other political problems before us.\\n122.\\tNevertheless, the prospect before us is not encouraging. From the very first meeting of this session the sharp division of opinion on political problems has made itself felt. At earlier sessions, as we set to work, we were hopeful of reaching practical results in the political sphere and it was only as the days went by that the deep divergence of views became apparent, postponing the adoption of a concerted plan for peace and security. Our initial feeling of optimism was replaced by discouragement and scepticism.\\n123.\\tI trust that on this occasion the reverse will be...   \n",

       "58  It is an honour for me to participate in this new session of the General Assembly and to address this illustrious Hall on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Danilo Medina Sanchez, President of the Dominican Republic.\\nSince the founding of the United Nations 74 years ago, my country has been deeply committed to the Organization’s mission of cooperation for peace, security and the development of peoples. This year, that commitment was renewed when we assumed a non-permanent seat on its Security Council for the first time, despite being founders of the United Nations. That is, of course, a responsibility that honours and binds us. That is why, we have done our utmost since January to ensure that our contribution to the Council always involves the search for broad consensus, which facilitates decision-making and efficiency.\\nAs part of that work, at the beginning of the year, when we assumed the presidency, we organized an open debate on the impacts of climate-related disasters and their negative effects on international peace and security (see S/PV.8451). That debate takes on new meaning in the current context, following the wave of fires in the Amazon and the recent passage of Hurricane Dorian, which left behind a trail of shocking damage and many victims.\\nIt should be noted that for us and our Caribbean region, the effects of climate change are real, visible and devastating, and threaten the very existence of our countries. In that regard, we are encouraged by the fact that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres convened the Climate Action Summit to address climate action within the broader framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which we were very honoured to attend. We agree with him that climate change is the defining issue of our time and a direct existential threat. We have also been particularly attentive to the regional agenda in matters such as humanitarian aid for Venezuela or the preparation of the new support mission to Haiti.\\nWe have little...   \n",

The Dominican Republic is confident\\nthat he will lead it in an effective and fruitful manner. I\\nalso express my gratitude to the Secretary-General,\\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his most valuable contributions to\\nthe strengthening of the United Nations as an\\ninstitution. In addition, I wish to congratulate His\\nExcellency Mr. Jean Ping of Gabon and to\\nacknowledge his notable work in leading the most\\nrecent session.\\nThis sixtieth session of the General Assembly\\nshould go down in history as one of the most\\nmomentous United Nations sessions. Proof of that lies\\nin two areas of major significance on its agenda: first,\\naccountability with regard to the degree of\\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals\\nand renewal of the commitments made to achieve\\nthem; and secondly, setting out the course for reform of\\nthe Organization to adapt it so that it can address\\ncurrent challenging problems and guarantee the\\neffectiveness of its actions in order to ensure the\\ndevelopment, freedom and peace of all the world’s\\npeoples.\\nFor nations such as the one I represent, the\\nambitious agenda aimed at achieving the Millennium\\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015 has become the\\nkey governmental programme.\\nWhat could be more important to small\\nunderdeveloped nations with scarce natural resources\\nthan leading their people out of the socio-economic\\nabyss caused by poverty, poor health and the lack of\\neducation and productive employment? No political\\naction is more urgent — at least not in the Dominican\\nRepublic. Eliminating poverty in the world is a\\nmonumental task requiring unstinting political\\ncommitment and the collective participation of all\\nsocieties, as well as unlimited economic support from\\nthe developed na...   \n",
       "60  As we approach the second anniversary of the beginning of the worst catastrophe in almost a century, humankind has not yet been able to bring this terrible chapter of the coronavirus disease pandemic to an end. Nevertheless, we come to this forum with the hope of renewing and strengthening the bonds of cooperation and solidarity as fraternal nations.\\nThis community of States faces enormous challenges that can be effectively addressed only through renewed multilateralism. Indeed, in the face of pandemics, the climate emergency, the technological revolution and the need to articulate a new paradigm for the welfare state, it is vital to strengthen unity and cooperation among all nations.\\nWe have a historic responsibility to leave the world a better place than when we found it, but that is possible only if we take seriously the global transition towards a new ecological, sustainable, inclusive and equitable production model, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. That change is possible only through a global and multilateral effort that guarantees the rule of law, human rights and the well-being of all peoples, leaving no one behind.\\nDespite the unfortunate scenario created by the pandemic, our Government has promoted a free vaccination plan, the success of which can be seen in tangible results and telling statistics: 57 per cent of the eligible population is fully vaccinated, approximately 70 per cent has received at least one dose and more than 10 per cent has received a third dose, with a case fatality rate of 1.14 per cent — one of the lowest in the world.\\nIn line with our vision of shared responsibility to find a way out of the pandemic and because we have an inventory of vaccines that has allowed us to do so, we have donated, in a spirit of solidarity, some 820,000 doses to other countries in our region, as we are convinced that we will be safe only once we are all vaccinated.\\nHowever, although we ha...   \n",

I have every confidence that his diplomatic skill and experience will ensure that our deliberations will be fruitful, will help to strengthen international order and make for an even more beneficial peace among all the nations of the world.\\nI should also like to express our gratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Guido de Marco, for his competence and dignity, and for the manner in which he presided over the proceedings of the forty-fifth session.\\nMoreover, I wish to express our greetings to Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar for his inestimable efforts as Secretary-General of the Organisation. The dedication and the zeal with which he has discharged his lofty functions for nearly a decade, and the courage and devotion he has shown in remaining in the service of the ideals of the United Nations, have earned him high praise, which confirms the great esteem in which he is held by the nations of the world.\\nMy delegation is pleased to extend a very warm welcome on their membership of the Organization to the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Baltic Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

His personal and professional qualities and his dedication to the path of diplomacy augur well for the outcome of the session.\\nI also congratulate his predecessor, Ambassador Peter Florin, on the exemplary and impeccable way in which he presided over the forty-second session. His work contributed greatly to the Organization's good image. We also wish warmly to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the successes he has scored thanks to his persistent efforts for international peace and co-operation, efforts that have been widely and fully recognized by all members of this world body. The Nobel Peace Prize given to the peace-keeping forces is the best testimony of what we have just said. The Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization in addition to being a source of information of incalculable value for us all is a sure guide to follow in the various situations that exist in the interdependent world of today.\\nAs a member of the great Caribbean family I wish also to hail an exceptional Caribbean, the Ambassador of Barbados. Her intelligence and her hard work have earned her the appreciation of the international community represented in this forum, as shown by the support given to her candidacy for the presidency of the General Assembly.\\nIn referring to the Dominican Republic as a member of the great Caribbean family I am highlighting its geographical, political, economic and ethnic facts.

If the United Nations is to achieve the purpose for which it was setup, namely to bring States together with a view to promoting peace and improving the conditions in which man lives, on the basis of a general concept that necessarily embraces the whole of mankind, it must cease to be the restrictive war-time coalition which it was at its inception and must steadily reduce the hazard and uncertainty surrounding the conception of the qualifications required of an existing political entity before it can become a Member State.\\n4.\\tJust as the exaggerated pressure of the different political ideologies which divide the world today invests some of the applications for admission to the Organization with an element of artificiality, so, too, the struggle for the principle of self-determination is being waged with varying success in the context of the atmosphere of conflict in which the fundamental purposes of the Charter are being achieved.\\n5.\\tDespite adverse circumstances in which the principle of universality is being debated, recent sessions of the Assembly indicate that in the long run the imperative requirements of international life will prevail over subje...   \n",

It is therefore our hope that, guided by the values you represent, we shall be able, when our work is done, to say that the thirty-third session of the General Assembly made substantial progress and was able to dispel the intangible factors that have halted the advance towards a new policy of understanding and effective decisions in the difficult task imposed on us by the expectations of our times and by the United Nations Charter. \\n55.\\tWe wish to avail ourselves of this opportunity to extend our most cordial congratulations to Solomon Islands on its becoming a Member of this Organization. We are sure it will make a positive contribution towards the building of a better world, a task to which we are all committed.\\n56.\\tThe history of the Dominican Republic has been characterized by heroic deeds in the defence of liberty. In this difficult task, this is part of the contribution that American independence has made to the principles of democracy. Up to now we have been guided by and have followed those guidelines.\\n57.\\tWe cannot say that after 1844, when the Dominican Republic came into being as a free and independent State through the brave actions of a few, we have not had to rise up again because of the interference to which our national sovereignty was subjected.

Her example of dedication to public service will be remembered forever.\\nAfter a painful period, which left millions of victims, we are once again in this great setting, since, thanks to science, we have managed to overcome the worst effects of the coronavirus disease. But who would have foreseen that, in the twenty-first century, the spectre of war would once again haunt Europe? It has been a severe test, and we will hopefully learn lessons that better prepare us for the challenges ahead.\\nThose would be preventable situations if there were the will to work together to find answers to the pressing problems facing humankind. That should be clear to us by now because, in a globalized world, there are no borders when it comes to the effects of epidemics, conflicts and violence. Precisely because ours is such an intertwined world, far-reaching goals always require “transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, as the theme of this session of the General Assembly aptly puts it.\\nIt is essential to recognize that this Organization needs major reforms to shake it out of the comfort in which it has been operating. It must be stressed that what is important to our countries is to consolidate a renewed multilateralism.

       "0   Had the United Nations not been faced in its five years of existence with countless obstacles, had it not been called upon to deal with so many alarming symptoms in the historical development of a convalescent world, it would be difficult to justify its creation, to welcome its birth and to hang on it, as men hoist a banner to a masthead, the hopes of peace and security of a profoundly disturbed epoch. The fact is that the struggle which this young yet already sorely tried Organization has waged, and is still waging, is the best proof of the timeliness of its conception and creation, and of the urgent and imperious need for the work it is doing today.Certainly this has not been merely another episode in the political history of the peoples. The recent wars, with their unparalleled violence and enormous destructive power, engendered in the peoples a boundless desire for peace, concord and agreement. That is why the United Nations (united for agreement, concord and peace) neither can nor should be regarded as one of those familiar panaceas created for interested motives in international political laboratories with the object of providing temporary compromise solutions for more or less selfish problems; it must be recognized for what it is, a sacred idea conceived by the peoples at a time of grave and legitimate struggle for the permanent protection of their democratic existence, autonomy, dignity, peace and security.For these reasons it is a crime to obstruct it in its sacred mission. It is a crime to try to reduce it to a tool of selfish ideologies. It is a crime to use it as an instrument of war in times of peace. It is a crime not to render it due honour.“We the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war…” Thus reads the opening sentence of the Preamble of the United Nations Charter. Yet, today one of these nations, “determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” is violated and invaded b...   \n",
       "1   At the outset, I would like to congratulate Ambassador María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on her election as President of the General Assembly and to wish her every possible success. It is a great honour for me to be able to once again address the Assembly as President of the Dominican Republic. This is a special occasion for our country, because next year the Dominican Republic will sit on the Security Council as a nonpermanent member for the first time.On behalf of  the Dominican people and myself,    I would therefore like to start by thanking the States Members of the United Nations for the support we have received in joining the Security Council. In particular, I thank the members of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States for the trust placed in us. Our purpose during our term will be to contribute a voice for Latin America and the Caribbean to one of the forums for greater  global responsibility  in   the   maintenance of peace.Of course, we are committed to asserting, both in the Security Council and in the Assembly, the same unbreakable principles that guide us as a nation. Respect for human rights, democracy, freedom and diversity will therefore be the beacon that we will follow in order to guide our work in the Security Council. We will do everything possible to honour the trust placed in us, being fully aware that, although fragile, stability and security are priority objectives that must be preserved and progress made towards, step by step and day by day.It is clear to us that in a space that addresses issues that can change the course of history and the fate of millions of people, we cannot seek easy and drastic solutions, which in any case do not exist. In that context, our country will always be a place of dialogue and understanding, and will always seek peaceful solutions. We are always willing to do whatever it takes to find common ground and support consensus as the best tool for peace and development. We will therefore always promote rap...   \n",
       "2        May I begin my speech, Mr. President, by conveying to you on behalf of the delegation of the Dominican Republic our heartiest congratulations on your election to preside over the deliberations of this twentyfirst session of the General Assembly.    These sentiments also express our conviction that you will guide our labours so wisely yet so firmly that we can even now anticipate the chorus of praise and recognition from the delegations here present at the success of your noble efforts, in the high position you occupy by the vote of this Assembly, to achieve peace and the solution of the problems facing us.    It is not with empty words of vainglory or boasting, but backed by the exact not to say strict expression of historical truth, that I state that never in the history of the United Nations has there appeared before a meeting of the General Assembly a delegation of the Dominican Republic possessing credentials of such remarkable political value as those displayed by the delegation which I have the honour to lead.    Born out of elections in which the Dominican people gave vigorous and unequivocal support to the programme of the victorious party in a contest whose legality and fairness were vouched for by impartial observers representing various trends of contemporary political and social thought, the Government of Mr. Joaquin Balaguer, which I have the honour to represent at this rostrum, embodies in the most positive manner the people aspirations for justice and progress and guarantees my country complete identification with the United Nation profession of faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person.    As a fortunate result of representations made by the Dominican Republic in the Organization of American States, the InterAmerican Peace Force, stationed in my country as a sequel to the painful events which filled the Republic with grief and ruin, was withdrawn. My Government then approached the SecretaryGeneral of ...   \n",
       "3   Mr. President, before beginning my statement on behalf of the delegation of the Dominican Republic I should like to express in this General Assembly the great sorrow which overwhelms the Government and people of the Dominican Republic at the tragedy which our sister Republic of Honduras is living through. Honduras which; in this period of its history, is making extraordinary efforts to achieve progress on the road towards development, at this time suddenly has to face the violent forces of destiny. There has been practically total destruction as though an apocalyptic hand wanted to plunge it into despair. But that is why we are all here, the sister republics of Honduras, meeting in this international forum so that we may here raise our voices and help in an effective manner the families which are at this time living through terrible anxiety. We express our solidarity with and condolences to Honduras.The Dominican Republic, which takes pride in being one of the founding Members of the United Nations, has always paid its tribute of faith to the principles of the Organization, which have opened tip new horizons for an international legal order, the structure of whirs > as since its establishment resisted the onslaughts on the circumstances of life of peoples, is pleased to extend to the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, our most cordial good wishes on his election, through the unanimous will of the countries represented here, to allow him to preside over this session and to guide us with his wellknown experience and wisdom in the tasks which await us.We know very well that, as well as having eminent qualifications, he is a patriot determined to bring about the progress of Algeria so as to maintain in the forefront the prestige which it enjoys as a country which loves peace and independence, which has outstanding virtues and is concerned to see that the ideals and principles of the Charter will also contribute to the rule of peace and brot...   \n",
       "4    May I first of all on behalf of theDominican Republic and on behalf of its ConstitutionalPresident, Mr. Joaquín Balaguer, express our sincerestcongratulations to the President of the fiftieth session ofthe General Assembly.Secondly, I wish to express our profound gratitudeto the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic ofCôte d’Ivoire, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, whopresided over the fortyninth session and, particularly, tothe SecretaryGeneral, who, by his extraordinary effortsand tireless dedication in a world marked by challengesand breaches of the peace, wages a daily combat for thefull implementation of the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter.The Dominican Republic can affirm with pride onthis fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the UnitedNations its role as a founding Member of the UnitedNations, which signed the San Francisco Charter withinthe international order that rose from the ashes of theSecond World War, whose fiftieth anniversary we alsocommemorate, and as a country that defends the principleof sovereignty as the inalienable right of the people.Fifty years after the creation of the United Nationsin  the world is in a state of transition toward whathas been termed a new world order, moving frombipolarity to unipolarity in a multipolar world, followingupon the world built in Yalta and in the Bretton Woodsagreements.The order was based on a balance of powerand on the United Nations as a reflection of the realdesire to seek security and universal peace — and theOrganization has managed, since its creation, to avertanother nuclear holocaust.General Assembly d plenary meetingFiftieth session October Small countries such as the Dominican Republic,staunch guardians of their national sovereignty, havewitnessed during the five decades since this ordercreated through the United Nations and its specializedagencies, with Bretton Woods, the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO), the Council for Economic Aid(COMECON), the Wars...   \n",
       "5    At the close of the seventh session of the General Assembly, all the peoples devoted to international order, freedom and prosperity felt a deep satisfaction based on the heartfelt hope that, with the signing of the armistice at Panmunjom and the tangible results achieved there, there had been ensured not only, the final cessation of hostilities in the martyred land of Korea but also the initiation and success of negotiations that would lead to the speedy restoration of peace in that country, which had suffered premeditated aggression at the hands of governments whose goal was world domination by violence and hatred, in full accordance with the baneful purposes of international communism.For the vast majority of the member States of the international community, and especially for the small countries like the Dominican Republic, the success of the action undertaken and sustained by the initiative and under the auspices of the United Nations in defence of right and justice has shown, at the cost of' indescribable suffering and sacrifice, the urgent need for organizing and putting into effect a powerful system of defence of the international community, based on the requirements of collective security.If it is possible to single out, among the essential purposes of the United Nations Charter, one that can be considered as most important, it is that which requires that the moral force of justice should be constantly strengthened by the categorical and effective warning that the days when might was right have gone forever. Thus the United Nations is based on the outright condemnation of aggression and violence, and on due submission to the principles and rules under which the life of the international community is organized and developed. The Charter is, in short, the triumphant proclamation of the values of the spirit as against the schemings of force and materialism which bring in their train destruction, poverty, suffering and death.It is, then, in no way surprisin...   \n",
       "6   We convey our warmest congratulations to the renowned Libyan diplomat Mr. Ali Treki on his recent election to preside over the General Assembly at this sixtyfourth session, as well as for his call for a dialogue among civilizations, for interreligious understanding, for the promotion for peace and security and for closing the divide between rich and poor.  Exactly one year ago, when we were taking stock of progress made towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals at the midterm point, something unexpected occurred: the collapse of some of the most emblematic investment banks, and with that the worsening of the global financial crisis.   Before this crisis occurred, however, the world, in particular the developing countries, was already affected by the impact of two other crises that had begun simultaneously: the crisis involving oil prices and that involving food prices.  As a result of the first of these crises, that is, the oil crisis, vigorous and intense social protest broke out in various parts of the world. Suddenly, all products became more expensive. Governments were forced to use their currency reserves to pay their oil bills and were forced to allocate subsidies for the sake of maintaining civic peace and democratic governance.   When it comes to the second crisis, the food crisis, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations established that as a result of the food crisis, the number of people suffering from hunger worldwide rose by million, which meant that for the first time in human history the total figure exceeded the number of billion human beings.   Before these two crises broke out, the World Bank had already indicated that in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals in the remaining seven years — that is, between and — $billion were still needed, or $billion every year. Obviously, with the outbreak of these crises, which gravely affected the economies of developing countries, the resources needed to meet the objectiv...   \n",
       "7   ﻿The Dominican Republic wasamong the countries that founded the United Nations. Butthis is only the third time, in years, that its Head ofState has come to address the General Assembly. Perhapsthe reason for this noticeable absence of our country duringthe many years that this great annual event has been heldis that following the Second World War, the internationalsystem revolved around superPower rivalry, giving rise tothe cold war. In context, it is probable that our leaders feltthat their presence here would have been merely symbolic,with no real importance.That this may have been the case in the past, but theworld has changed. From the dramatic transformations inthe geopolitical environment, a multipolar internationalsystem has emerged, in which the economy matters morethan ideologies and military conflicts. This reorganizationof the international system on the basis of strategiceconomic objectives has been accompanied by a scientificand technological revolution, a revolution of knowledge thatspread across the planet and brought about the mostprofound change ever experienced in the history ofhumankind, turning the world into one large neighbourhood.In the new international order that arose following thecold war, the Dominican Republic could not remainisolated. That is why we are here today: to proclaim to theworld that the Dominican Republic is now actively joiningthe group of nations represented in this multilateralOrganization, so that, through international contacts andexchange, it can contribute to forging a better future forhumanity and, accordingly, a more promising future forDominicans.To ensure our participation in the various forums ofthe United Nations forums, exercising all the rights thathave been bestowed upon us, we proceeded, first, to payour financial debts in full.

       "8   Mr. President, first of all I wish to convey to you my congratulations on your election in the certainty that your wisdom and your qualities as a statesman and a student of the problems which affect the international political scene are guarantees that the tasks before us will lead to effective results to the satisfaction of all peoples of the world.An outstanding thinker of the Antilles and foremost sociologist propounded the thesis that the moral progress of peoples runs in the opposite sense to the course of their material progress. That sociological concept applies to the successive periods of the history of civilization.In the world of today we are witnessing technological and scientific progress of such dimensions that we could almost say that it has outstripped man fantasy, which has always been governed by his tremendous imagination. Thus we have come today to the invention of destructive weapons which could wipe out the human race; and, similarly, with the arrival of man on the moon we can say that we have entered upon the stage of the domination of outer space.Today, almost everyone concedes that at this juncture in civilization, material progress, spurred by science, has changed the characteristics of a natural process in man that is to say, the structure of the individual and collective mentality.It would be difficult to forecast how far nations can be carried by the undeniable, realistic postulate which suggests the existence of an inverse ratio between material progress and moral progress in society today.From those considerations we could reach the view, which has been repeated since ancient times, that truly man is his own worst enemy. Hence the idea of domination at the cost of destruction and war has still not disappeared.The work done by the United Nations to achieve peace and eliminate the scourge of war, the events that have occurred and the actions that have been taken from the San Francisco Conference to the present day to avoid the spread...   \n",

At the outset, I would like to welcome and congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session.This anniversary gives us the opportunity to put in perspective what the Organization has meant for humankind. It was established years ago as the fruit of the worst horrors of war and as the first global forum created to preserve peace, coexistence and the well being of all human beings. It is true that the United Nations was born of the wounds, pain and fear left by the great conflicts of the twentieth century, but it also arose from the unstoppable force of hope and the iron will of great men and women who believed in dialogue, solidarity and the grandeur of the human race.Although we still have far to go and although immense challenges remain, the Organization continues to represent the values that inspire us day\n",

We are also putting the final touches on a renewed commitment to global development, which is enshrined in the postdevelopment agenda in the form of the Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution . At the same time, the industrialized nations have finally taken a decisive and resolute step forward to combat climate change.

       "10  ﻿Mr. President, permit me, in these first words, after congratulating you on the assumption of your important office, to express the confidence that we have in your wisdom and exceptional experience in the matters which affect the States which constitute the United Nations. Also permit us to extend, on behalf of the Government of the Dominican Republic, our congratulations and thanks to the General Committee of our Assembly over which you preside for the spontaneous initiative, which does it credit, of including item in the agenda of this thirtyfourth session of the General Assembly. This item relates to measures for providing assistance to my country and to the Commonwealth of Dominica, a small country which, like our own, was cruelly battered by the fury of the hurricanes of this season of cyclones in the Caribbean.We must admit that this, too, represents a contribution to the peace for which the United Nations is fighting so heroically, a contribution which takes into account in circumstances like these, not only the scourge of war, but also the destructive force of nature. This tragedy, which afflicts the peoples suffering from the results of the hurricanes, inevitably gives rise not only to hunger and destruction, but also to all the upsetting results produced when economies are disrupted and when human suffering reaches such depths that it bears comparison with what happens when war, an apocalyptic figure bent upon uprooting the constitutional instrument of the United Nations, is unleashed.Our country was the victim in less than five days of two cruel hurricanes which spread tragedy, horror and chaos among its inhabitants, who were hoping for a future of peace and labour in a climate of democracy, and when the Dominican Government had already set up action programmes for the economic development of the nation and had been mobilizing all the forces of production, in many scientifically new and revolutionary areas, in order to make the best use of all the re...   \n",

Our regional group is proud and honoured at his election, since his wellknown skill and experience will ensure that the work of this session will be guided to a successful conclusion.This is a fitting occasion to highlight the work accomplished by the outgoing President, Mr. Imre Hollai, who so ably led the proceedings of the thirtyseventh session.Since my country is a member of the great family of the Caribbean, we are pleased to welcome most cordially the new free, sovereign and independent State of Saint Christopher and Nevis to the Organization. We share with our brothers of that new nation their legitimate satisfaction at having exercised the most sacred rights of peoples: selfdetermination. Our country was gratified to be present at the celebration of the national independence of this fraternal country and to bring a message of friendship and cooperation from the Dominican Government and the people, reaffirming once again the Caribbean focus of the present policy of the Dominican Republic.We come to this thirtyeighth session deeply concerned at the continued deterioration of various aspects of the international scene. The crises afflicting peace loving nations require of the Organization a joint effort to seek the means and machinery to face the problems and find appropriate solutions.This great effort should be characterized by active international cooperation with the united participation of all the Members of the United Nations.At this difficult time in the history of mankind international cooperation, which is an essential element for harmonious coexistence among nations, must be the force behind our actions if we are to overcome the present situation.At this stage of international life, the maj...   \n",

The outstanding qualities of the new President have become manifest during the years in which he has served with distinction and brilliance as representative of his country in this world Organization and in other diplomatic posts.His tact, moderation, sound judgement, conscientiousness and legal abilities augur well that the problems facing the United Nations will be approached and considered in the way that will most benefit mankind now and in the future.The Dominican people, as a member of the family of American nations, are glad that a representative of our group will serve as President of this General Assembly and, even more so, that he is a worthy representative of the country of Bolívar. This is so because the Dominican people owe a debt of gratitude to the people of Venezuela as their most steadfast supporters in the arduous struggle to free themselves from the cruel tyranny to which they had been subject for more than thirty years.The Dominican Republic stands before you today painfully shaken by the recent events that have caused the suspension of the constitutional rule which began on February of this year. The facts, true or false, have been reported in all quarters of the world, and have aroused great uncertainty.We are the first to regret what has occurred, but in the face of the accomplished fact and completely alien to it, we have acceded to the appeal of the people, and, without any political commitments other than those imposed by the need to help the country and the desire to restore as quickly as possible the constitutionality that has been suspended, ...   \n",
       "14  The voice of the Dominican Republic, which is raised, not for the first time, in support of mankind’s endeavor to defend peace based on justice, has a moral right to be heard in these precincts because of the sincerity which has inspired the actions of the Dominican people throughout their history.In the darkest days of, the war, when the fate of the democracies appeared still uncertain, our country collaborated actively on behalf of the cause of right then being upheld on the battlefield by the peoples who are today sharing in the deliberations of this high assembly, now meeting in an atmosphere of uneasiness. This fact should, however, only spur it on to greater efforts for the benefit of mankind.A few hours after the treacherous attack on Pearl Harbor, the Dominican Republic, honouring its tradition of law and its international engagements, resolutely went to war to show its solidarity with, and to share the fortunes of, the victim of that hateful aggression, thus taking part at its side in the hazards and responsibilities of the struggle for the defence of freedom of the peoples, and of human dignity. In conformity with this attitude, on the historic occasion of the third meeting of Foreign Ministers in Rio de Janeiro, we championed a joint declaration of war by all the American nations against the totalitarian powers. For the sake of continental solidarity, we supported the agreements there adopted, although they were in fact less radical than the position taken up and the views maintained by the people and Government of the Dominican Republic.As soon as victory began to dawn on the horizon, victory won at the price of such cruel sacrifices, we devoted all our energies to securing effective collaboration in the efforts at San Francisco to produce a world organization worthy of the high destiny of mankind and of civilization.Once the proposal which brought the United Nations into bang had taken final shape, we placed all our reserves of faith and hope in it....   \n",

I look forward confidently to his complete success in this sensitive undertaking inasmuch as he is a skilled and seasoned diplomat from a region which is undergoing a steady process of growth and development  a fact that can be observed in the importance and the scope of the Convention concluded between the European Economic Community and the African, Caribbean aid Pacific States, better known as the lome Convention, the progress of which we have been following in our country with much interest and with a great feeling of solidarity. His outstanding personal qualities will ensure that the work and the deliberations of this session will be guided with due deliberation and the highest aims. In this respect, he can count on our resolute cooperation.This is a suitable opportunity to express our high esteem for that outstanding Argentine internationalist, Mr, Dante Caputo, for his exemplary guidance of the work of the last session.On this solemn occasion we should like to place on record our great appreciation and admiration for the SecretaryGeneral of our Organization, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the valuable, timely and unstinting work that he has been doing to promote peace and understanding among the peoples and nations of the Earth.At the beginning of my statement I should like to thank the representatives for their attention to lay sincere message of goodwill from a part of the globe that has been called upon to play a major role from the time of the arrival in the New World of the visionary, the admiral of the seas Christopher Columbus, ...   \n",

On this great occasion I am happy to convey the homage and goodwill of the Government and people of the Dominican Republic, and their sincere affection, to one who in bringing honour to his own country also enhances the prestige of his fellows of the Americas.  Mr. Emilio Arenales is a statesman of firmly democratic persuasion and deep moral convictions; an ardent believer in the ideal of justice proclaimed by the United Nations. There can be no doubt that under his able guidance the twentythird session of the General Assembly will achieve substantial successes adding to the stature of the international community, which finds its highest expression in this Assembly. We pray fervently and with reverent humility that by the grace of God, our President may be enabled fully to meet the enormous responsibilities we have placed upon his learning, his wisdom, his poise and his prudence.  I am quite sure that not only our President, but all of us who are assembled here and in some degree symbolize the aspirations of millions of human beings need the guiding light of God’s Providence; for this twentythird session of the General Assembly is beginning its work in a disquieting atmosphere of political unrest mainly deriving from dangerous backgrounds of economic and social frustration. There is nothing easy in the task which faces us, but the difficulties must nevertheless be overcome. We must direct our efforts towards that allimportant end even though we are bound to give warning that noone must expect us to produce a miraculous potion capable of curing forthwith all the material and spiritual ills afflicting the less fortunate peoples and individuals.

We are confident that, guided by your knowledge and by the prestige which you will impart to our debates and deliberations, the twentysixth session of the General Assembly will have special historic significance, because here we will achieve the progress which has long been anxiously awaited and we feel sure that we will take one more step towards the rule of law for which we are all, as Member States, equally responsible.On this happy occasion, allow me also to express our best wishes for the success of this important session, and at the same time I should like to extend a hearty welcome to the new States of Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar, which have come to swell the membership of this universal Organization.Finally, my country wishes to pay a wellearned tribute to SecretaryGeneral U Thant for his outstanding work in the lofty post which he now holds.We, the representatives who have gathered together here at the twentysixth session, are filled with concern over those matters which were not resolved at the past sessions. Now we are equipped with the means and instruments provided by the United Nations system, which should make it possible for us to meet the needs of the international community.Understandably enough, many of the issues which have been held over without any progress having been made are such as to require that we overcome considerable difficulties, though these matters deserv...   \n",
       "19  It is an honour to participate once again in the General Assembly on behalf of the people of the Dominican Republic. I wish to begin my remarks with a special recognition of the work of SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon. We appreciate his dedication in the search for solutions to the conflicts that have shaken the world over the past years, and we wish him the best of luck in the new tasks that he will undertake.The year is proving to be especially turbulent, with territorial conflicts and open identityrelated tensions in various parts of the world. We hope and insist, of course, that the international community will find a peaceful outcome to those conflicts — first and foremost for the sake of the millions of lives that are affected by them. Sometimes the urgency inherent in those tragedies weakens our commitment to address problems that appear to be less pressing but are the most important in the long term.One such issue, with perhaps the largest scope and greatest potential for longterm transformation, is the fight against poverty and inequality. Over the past two decades, the rapid economic growth brought about by economic globalization has fuelled high expectations in the countries of the South. In fact, it was believed that the prosperity enjoyed by a few countries might finally be within everyone’s reach. It should be recognized that those hopes were not unfounded. Indeed, over the course of those two decades, hundreds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty.But we cannot let ourselves be carried away by excessive optimism. We have an obligation to clarify the scope of those gains in the light of the actual data. We must also expand our horizons to observe those places and areas where globalization has not kept the promises made to humankind.To begin with, we must remember that all of the hundreds of millions of people who were recently lifted out of poverty did not automatically become part of the middle class, nor did all who were able to do so nece...   \n",

       "21  On behalf of the Government and the people of the Dominican Republic, it is a pleasure to extend our warmest congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia upon his recent election as President of the General Assembly. We would also like to take this opportunity to greet the members of the General Assembly.  During the four years following the Millennium Summit of  the Dominican Republic went through a crisis, during which our national currency was devalued by per cent. Our working class had to double its efforts simply to meet their basic subsistence needs. Drug trafficking and high levels of crime gained a foothold, and our credibility went down worldwide. According to the statistics of the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, more than million out of the million Dominicans sank into the lowest levels of poverty. At that time, we were facing one of the most dramatic crises in the modern history of the Dominican Republic.  Since we took the reins of administration in  the Dominican Republic has managed to recover the confidence of investors and entrepreneurs. We have been able to reactivate economic growth. We have been able to reduce inflation. We have increased jobs and improved social conditions and quality of life for the Dominican people.  However, exactly when we began, just like the phoenix rising from its own ashes, a gloomy international picture threatened to darken our prospects for future growth. In recent weeks, for example, the price of oil on the international market has reached an unprecedented rate, and projections point towards continued increases. These price increases are asphyxiating our economies.  Similarly, in recent times, as a result of changes on the international stage, free zone companies in the Dominican Republic, alongside those in Mexico and Central America, have been losing their competitive edge to Asian countries. ...   \n",
       "22  If we review the activities of the United Nations since the days of San Francisco, we realize that never before has mankind been so deeply concerned with the question of peace, this peace which we have not yet been able to achieve despite all our efforts and despite the material we have collected and examined in the hope of offering this great achievement to future generations. The fact is that the human and natural elements in our difficult task of reconciling various aspirations, ideals and interests are so prominent that we are at times dramatically made aware of our shortcomings, of obvious areas of disagreement and of lack of comprehension.How, then, can we achieve peace? That is the main concern of the delegation representing the Dominican Republic at this eleventh session of the General Assembly, which is attended by the largest number of Member States in its history — the old founder States, like our own, those which joined later, and the new Members which are to offer us their muchneeded cooperation, inasmuch as we agree that the universality of the United Nations, one of our longstanding hopes, is one of the main objectives of the Charter.Yet the task of achieving peace has its price and is beset with thorny problems. The price must be paid in respect of any human endeavour and the thorny problems will arise because no path is ever entirely smooth. The peace that we all long for and that would fulfil the yearning of millions of human beings throughout the world has implications and a meaning of considerable importance for the world today; it could be achieved through joint and sincere efforts if each, one of us were to act in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and develop his capabilities and if nations, like men, and States, like individuals, attained such a degree of social equilibrium and tolerance that they could discharge their domestic obligations without neglecting their foreign obligations and meet their international ...   \n",

As a result of that commitment to peace and dialogue among peoples, this Organization was born in whose General Assembly I am honored to participate today for the first time on behalf of the Dominican people, and in whose name I congratulate the United Nations on its h Anniversary.The world of is evidently different from that of and I am confident to proclaim that it is also better. And it is so, to a large extent, thanks to the United Nations effort during these three quarters of a century to maintain international peace and security, encourage cooperation between peoples to solve global problems and serve, ultimately, as meeting point for the nations that share this planet.Without the UN the Universal Declaration of Human Rights would not exist, something inconceivable for us today; neither would we have organizations like UNICEF, FAO, the World Health Organization, the World Bank or international criminal courts. Nor would have been carried out the peacekeeping missions that, through its history, have avoided so much suffering.The world of is better than in but far from perfect.

In conferring on him such an outstanding honour, the Organisation has recognised his outstanding diplomatic work and his devotion to the cause of peace.He also wish to congratulate the President of the fortyfourth session, the Ambassador of Nigeria, Major General Joseph Garba, on the excellent work he did and on the wisdom and discretion with which he overcame innumerable obstacles.We reiterate our gratitude to the SecretaryGeneral, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, who has spared no efforts in the cause of world peace.

Its dynamic nature has proliferated in more and more activities; its indefatigable enterprise has created new agencies, its efforts have spread to ever wider horizons. For all these things this honourable institution deserves the gratitude and applause of the nations of the world; but activity, initiative and effort are all the more praiseworthy in proportion as they attain the goals which they set out to attain.The greatest brains of our time in the political, economic and scientific world have contributed the best of their Intelligence to bringing about the success of the immense project inaugurated by the Charter of the United Nations, which was signed in San Francisco a little more than ten years ago.

Without peace there can be no economic progress or social development.Peace is not merely the absence of war or peace imposed by a superior force.

The General Assembly was meeting in an atmosphere of tranquillity under the leadership of a distinguished statesman, General Romulo, who could be described as the embodiment of the spirit of human kindness.The task before the Assembly was not easy, nothing was more arduous than the effort to reconcile conflicting ideologies and interests. Good will, however, had power akin to faith, which moved mountains.While the Assembly agenda covered a vast number of topics, the political items, which occasioned the great differences, were not as numerous as in the past; moreover, they had all been discussed previously.The question of the disposal of the former Italian colonies was of primary importance. Mr. Henriquez Ureña hoped the Assembly would find an equitable and workable solution of the problem during that session; the position of the Dominican Republic thereon had already been clearly indicated and it would remain unchanged. Any solution designed to ensure the preparation of those former colonies for selfgovernment or independence, through an orderly process carried out under the supervision of the United Nations, would have the support of the delegation of the Dominican Republic.The Dominican Republic maintained an equally firm attitude with regard to any problem involving respect for the independence and sovereignty of a State. For that reason it could not remain indifferent to another question which had already been debated in past sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, namely, the threat to the political independence and territorial integrity of Greece. Not only was the sacred principle of independence attacked by such threats but also another principle, that of nonintervention, which the American Republics had e...   \n",

In  the twentieth special session of the General Assembly was held to contribute to the elimination or substantial reduction of the illegal production of drugs and drug abuse by  Ten years later, at a followup review meeting supported by this prestigious world body, the conclusion was reached that little progress had been made regarding the proposed goals and that there were therefore plenty of reasons for the international community to be concerned about the growing threat posed by the global drug problem. It was determined that a new year plan was needed to cover the period until  when the General Assembly will have once again to convene Member States in order to assess the outcome of measures implemented to eliminate the most serious threat to our citizens’ safety at the dawn of the twentyfirst century: transnational organized crime and illegal drug trafficking.  Today, almost million people between the ages of and consume drugs worldwide. Although that consumption extends to many regions around the world, the highest concentration of users is found in areas with the most pronounced economic and social development, such as the United States, Western Europe and Central Asia.  Drug consumption is harmful to health, causing personality disorders that often lead to loss of will, apathy and the development of pathological behaviour. Furthermore, tens of thousands of people die every year as a direct result of drug consumption, while others, depending on the way these toxic substances are consumed, are affected by diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C.

At the outset, I would like to apologize on behalf of Mr. Danilo Madina Sánchez, President of the Dominican Republic, for his absence from the debate, as he has had to return to our country to deal with Hurricane Maria.Our meeting this week coincides with the devastating season of natural disasters that our region has been enduring for nearly a month with terrible consequences. The disasters have also spread to Mexico, which has been hit by two destructive earthquakes, and the southern United States, viciously punished by Hurricane Harvey. In the catalogue of human suffering caused by Hurricane Irma, that of Antigua and Barbuda stands out, particularly Barbuda, per cent of whose infrastructure has collapsed, according to its Prime Minister, Gaston Browne. Hardly had Irma’s devastating winds dropped than Maria arrived, leaving a new trail of destruction and death, inflicting a direct hit first on Dominica and today on its neighbour Puerto Rico, causing great destruction and damage.We take this opportunity to express our solidarity with Puerto Rico, which is also our neighbour, as well as with all the countries affected.

Your election is also a tribute of recognition and respect rendered to your wisdom, your qualities as a statesman and your devotion to the cause defended by the nations assembled in this world Organization. Under your enlightened and experienced guidance we are sure that the Assembly will embark upon a session which in and of itself is of great importance because of the tremendous tasks confronting all delegations, the significance of the anniversary that is coming up shortly and because here, as never before, a spirit of understanding and coexistence should prevail above all momentary considerations so that we may inaugurate a new phase in international law under the most auspicious circumstances. We are duty bound to display this spirit because of the wisdom, the experience and the maturity which we have gained during twentyfour regular sessions of the General Assembly, sessions which have led us to the point where we will be commemorating this exceptional event very shortly in solemn ceremony and celebration.It is, therefore, an honor for my delegation to convey to you our good wishes on your ...   \n",

His great learning, his long experience in the service of the loftiest of international causes, his wisdom and judgement are, as we have seen here, the attributes that go to make a good President.On behalf of the people and Government of the Dominican Republic, I extend a hearty welcome to the new States which are joining this family of nations. Our welcome and our best wishes go to Rwanda, Burundi, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago, as also to Algeria, which has just been admitted to the United Nations.At home, the Dominican Republic has begun to make amends for the cruelties, tortures, persecutions, assassinations, deprivations and abuses inflicted on the Dominican; nation by the tyrant Trujillo, who was fortunately brought to justice on May  by a group of national heroes whose two sole surviving members, Mr. Antonio Imbert Barrera and Mr. Luis Amiama, are serving on the Council of State.The present Government has undertaken to attend to the immediate needs created by the chaotic situation and, with the resolute cooperation of the people and the help of the Alliance for Progress programme, it has provided new opportunities for employment in emergency public works projects. The wealth amassed under the dictatorship has been invested in a development corporation which is using, for the benefit of the Dominican people and on behalf of that people, the riches of which they had previously been divested.

The presidency of the General Assembly constitutes a singular honour to the Member State that occupies it, as well as to its regional group. My delegation also congratulates Mr. Kittani, who presided over the thirtysixth session of the General Assembly with great success. My delegation also wishes to express its gratitude to the SecretaryGeneral, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, whose experience and hard work in the service of the United Nations have already been clearly demonstrated, and represent for the countries of the American continent a source of legitimate pride and satisfaction. The report which he has submitted to the General Assembly is brilliant, and is proof of this; of the many documents that the Organization produces, only a very few are as important as this call to reflection. His words not only enumerate the great problems that oppress the world, but also propose solutions to these grave and multiple problems. With the sincerity and emotion essential to the task of considering the fate of peoples, the SecretaryGeneral has made recommendations that do not shrink from criticism of and alternatives for the action of bodies within the United Nations itself, such as the Security Council. His considered and valuable presentation has won the support and general approval of world opinion, and my delegation supports it fully.The Dominican Republic is conscious of the complex and serious problems affecting the international community that are being debated at this session, and of the fact that those problems require measures commensurate with their seriousness and urgency, We are confident that within the framework of the law and the principles of the Charter will ...   \n",

The finest tribute that could be paid to this extraordinary man, this standardbearer of peace, this apostle of brotherhood, would be to have all the nations represented here join selflessly in choosing as his successor someone capable of serving the United Nations with the same lofty spirit of selfsacrifice as he displayed in the cause of furthering the unity and solidarity of the human family. This tribute would also be extended to the great Swedish nation, which has given this world Organization two martyrs: Count Bernadotte, who fell heroically in the deserts of the Middle East, and now Dag Hammarskjold, struck down by the same fatality which has pursued all redeemers since God Himself died on the cross to give us an example of the power of blood to inspire great causes and great human ideals.For perhaps the first time in the history of the United Nations, a country of the Americas is reentering this world Organization after having acquired the moral licence to belong to an institution founded precisely to defend the right of man to live in a world free from fear and injustice. The Dominican Republic has been a Member of the United Nations since the Organization inception in  but it is only now, after years of purely theoretical adherence to the principles of the San Francisco Charter, that, in full awareness of its duties and responsibilities, it is really entering this world forum which should count among its Members only those nations for which international agreements are not a myth, and human rights not a fiction.

His election not only recognizes his personal influence, which has been felt in the United Nations ever since it was founded at San Francisco, but is also welldeserved tribute to his country, which has contributed so greatly to the development of international law and culture in America and as such is a source of profound satisfaction to all the Latin American countries. Our ideals of peace and justice in international relations have found in Mr. Belaúnde, with his brilliant intelligence, his scholarship, backed by solid religious and moral convictions and his moving eloquence, an outstanding champion in each of the phases in the history of our Organization which he so admirably described in his speech of acceptance [h meeting]. May I add my good wishes for the success of his work in the high office he now occupies.Once again the General Assembly is meeting to review what has been achieved and to initiate new efforts in the cause of peace and collective security, the most serious and urgent problem of our time and the raison d’être of the United Nations.In its exposition of the function of the main organs and in guiding principles of the United Nations, the Charter clearly established what might be described as the factors of peace and international security. The pacific settlement of international disputes, the development of respect for the principle of equal rights and selfdetermination of peoples, the control and ultimate elimination of the armaments race, the solution of problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, the promotion of social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom — these are the conditions that must be satisfied if we are to attain the goals to which mankind’s hopes for peace and security are directed.In the case of each of thes...   \n",
       "42  It is a pleasure for my delegation, Mr. President, to offer you its congratulations on the honour which the Assembly has conferred on you and your country by appointing you to preside over the work of the present session. The experience you have demonstrated in similar capacities in other United Nations organs and in other posts, and your ability, prudence and other qualities are undoubtedly an assurance of success in your present duties.My delegation is also happy to welcome to this Organization the new States of Malawi, Malta and Zambia, which have come to take on and to share the heavy responsibilities imposed on all Members of the United Nations by its Charter. The admission of these Members to the Organization is a further step on the way to decolonization, and the fact that when the Charter was signed in there were fiftyone Members, whereas today the original number has more than doubled, with African nations predominating among the new Members, shows how much progress has been made.The remarks of the Dominican Republic on this occasion and at this stage of the general debate will, in view of the present circumstances, necessarily be very brief and be confined to some aspects of the problems which most directly concern it within the framework of the United Nations. Before taking these up, however, we must express our hope and earnest wish that the difficulties. which the Organization is now facing may be dealt with in a realistic spirit and be satisfactorily overcome, so that its existence and authority may be reaffirmed and it may carry out the task assigned to it in the preamble of the Charter, for the good of mankind. It is hardly necessary for me to say that the United Nations must be preserved at all costs and regardless of the sacrifices involved and that we must all do our utmost to preserve it, since it is our common heritage built up over the centuries in an endeavour to find a formula enabling people to live together in peace and understanding.

       "43  In response to the unanimous sentiments of the people of the Dominican Republic, my Government comes for the seventh time to this General Assembly in order to give further evidence of its firm resolve to contribute unwaveringly and unconditionally by every means at its disposal to the efforts made by the United Nations in the difficult task of attempting through conciliation and agreement to find a just solution of the many problems and disputes that have been submitted to it for consideration and decision. These problems and disputes reflect the most varied aspects of the serious social and political crisis through which our generation is passing m these difficult times, and they confront the world with the terrible threat of war and destruction. Our participation in the noble work of the General Assembly is based, as always, upon an imperative desire for international cooperation. That we are able to realize that desire is the result of one of the most outstanding victories of contemporary civilization in the field of international law, namely, the final and complete recognition of the equal sovereignty of States, irrespective of their military strength or the extent of their territories.We in the Dominican Republic are convinced that this fundamental principle of equality, which unites in this Assembly the community of the nations of the world on the basis of their common right to participate in the examination and discussion of problems and points of disagreement and, consequently, in the taking of decision designed to settle such matters, can and should be a sufficient stimulus to the creation and strengthening of an unshakeable faith that this eminent body can ensure a progressive implementation of the principles of international law and the supremacy of justice which will eventually make it possible for confidence and mutual respect to prevail in relations between States.

His election is a guarantee that this will be so, despite the magnitude of the task and the obstacles that will stand in the way of our efforts to find viable solutions to the problems on our agenda that will satisfy all the interests concerned and the aspirations that we all share. Under your skilful direction we must hope that all the difficulties, disagreements and misunderstandings that may arise during this session that is just starting will be helped by the moderating spirit and the harmonious goodwill that prevailed at the birth of our Organization at San Francisco. The United Nations gained maturity after being subjected to the most cruel tests, which, far from having weakened its power as the chief instrument for saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war, have enabled it to rise afresh each time with the necessary vitality to safeguard and to proclaim with authority the pronouncements in the preamble and the guiding principles enshrined in the Charter. At the last session of the General Assembly, the delegation of the Dominican Republic appeared for the first time as the genuine representatives of a democratic State ruled by a constitutional Government elected by universal suffrage, after the vicissitudes that the principles on which the Republic had been based in had suffered for many years.

His election augurs well for the balanced and fruitful conduct of this session.

Its efforts to realize the ideals of justice pursued by the United Nations will undoubtedly prove to be an asset to the Organization.The international situation, which grows more alarming each passing day, should be a matter of collective concern to all peaceloving nations and should, of necessity, lead them to strengthen the United Nations.

       "46  Mr. BALAGUER said that it was the first time that the General Assembly of the United Nations had met on the soil of France, the mother of liberty and the cradle of human rights. If the atmosphere of the world were at present less charged with anxiety and if the shadow of a fresh catastrophe did not darken the future of humanity, it would have been said that that change of headquarters, apart from whatever other motives involved, fulfilled a purpose of incalculable moral value. The three regular sessions of the Assembly of the United Nations had been held in the three countries of the world which most strongly represented the principles of political freedom and of respect for individual rights. The United Nations Organization, born in San Francisco, had been initiated in London; it had drawn its first breath in England, as though it had been desired that the representatives of all the nations should strengthen their faith in the renewal of liberty by the splendid sight of a famous people which had just arisen from the ruins of war, as a symbol of the indestructibility of the human spirit and as a symbol of justice and right — values which would never die, however persecuted.The General Assembly had then moved to the United States of America, the most powerful democracy on earth and the home of the people which had decided the issue of the tremendous conflict by throwing into the balance the most formidable fighting machine that the world had ever seen.The capital of France, the country which, with the Encyclopedists, had seen the birth of the loftiest ideals of modern political thought, now welcomed the United Nations. France, a great country, which was the pride of Latin culture, would by its history give the moral impulse required to overcome the feelings of distrust and pessimism which were beginning to undermine the foundations of the United Nations as in its last days they had those of the League of Nations.The Dominican Republic, heir, like all the Latin Am...   \n",
       "47  In the list of items proposed for the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly, one on which the Collective Measures Committee has made a very thorough report is particularly outstanding: “ Methods which might be used to maintain and strengthen international peace and security in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter ”.The inclusion of this item holds out ground for hope, because all, or almost all, the political items in the agenda might yield results, could we but attain unanimity of opinion and resolve upon the adoption of such methods. Questions like the international control of atomic energy or the reduction and limitation of armaments could be solved provided we first reach general agreement on the manner in which peace is to be maintained and strengthened. We should also be on the way to finding practical and useful solutions for problems like those connected with the threats to the political independence and territorial integrity of certain Members of this world Organization. If we attain agreement on methods, we shall have gone halfway towards putting them into effect.I therefore attach the utmost importance to the item arising out of the report of the Collective Measures Committee, for, if we were to succeed in taking a unanimous decision on it we should be able, sooner or later, to solve all the other political problems before us.Nevertheless, the prospect before us is not encouraging. From the very first meeting of this session the sharp division of opinion on political problems has made itself felt. At earlier sessions, as we set to work, we were hopeful of reaching practical results in the political sphere and it was only as the days went by that the deep divergence of views became apparent, postponing the adoption of a concerted plan for peace and security. Our initial feeling of optimism was replaced by discouragement and scepticism.I trust that on this occasion the reverse will be the case; I trust that the init...   \n",

       "50  We extend our warmest congratulations to the Ambassador from Qatar, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz AlNasser, on his recent election as President of the General Assembly at its sixtysixth session. We welcome his intention to use this session to address pressing issues such as mediation and conflict resolution, the reform of the United Nations system, preventing and responding to natural disasters and sustainable development for global prosperity.  Ten years ago, the dynamic and vibrant city of New York was shocked by something previously inconceivable: the terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers. Thousands of innocent people died in horrific ways, leaving relatives and friends in a state of helplessness and sorrow. Echoes of that terror reverberated around the planet, leaving scars and a trail of pain to this day. The world has not been the same since then.  In the interest of security, even in strong democracies where genuine rule of law prevails, some individual liberties, previously considered sacred and immutable, have been sacrificed. While the ashes were still smouldering and the rubble of the Twin Towers still lay where it fell, the war in Afghanistan was launched, which, although perhaps justified as a case of legitimate defence, has nevertheless produced more victims than the terrorist attacks themselves. Then came the occupation of Iraq, which spurred controversy in various circles of international public opinion but in any case certainly generated more violence, produced new victims and new waves of human suffering and caused more destruction of wealth.  The lesson to be learned from these past years is that there must be a collective effort to eliminate terrorism as an inhuman practice, to eliminate as well the economic, social, political, cultural, ideological and religious factors that fuel it, and to promote a world that is more open, more tolerant, more respectful and more willing to engage in dialogue and in the recognition of human dignity.

We also take this opportunity to greet our fellow Member States in this General Assembly.   Eight years ago, in this same place, representatives of countries undertook a crucial commitment, possibly one of the most transcendental commitments that such a large number of nations ever made. They agreed on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In the year  it was believed — and this is still the case today — that the objectives established at that time would go down in the common history of humankind as the bravest ethical decision ever taken in the face of extreme poverty, the shame of generalized injustice and the heartbreaking tragedy of social inequity. It was an agenda of work and dedication that required a large dose of political will, actions laid out in conformity with the goals to be reached, a reorganization of budgetary priorities and a    greater flow of aid resources and support for development.   We did not undertake the Millennium Development Goals in vague terms. We did not couch the Millennium Declaration in abstract and grandiloquent concepts lacking in substance. Quite the contrary, we analysed with the greatest possible rigour the situation that we wanted to correct. We measured with mathematical precision its overwhelming scope and the magnitude of the political and financial effort that its reversal would require.   We committed to the MDGs with such supreme responsibility that we even set a date for their achievement: the year  Now we are halfway to that date, and we face the disheartening situation of an international landscape full of obstacles to overcome if we are to conclude what we set out to do in the year  We knew there would be difficulties.

In view of the great importance that the work of this session will have for the future of our organization, your election, Mr. President, could not have been wiser or more just. You possess not only a thorough knowledge of the work of the United Nations, acquired over a period of many years, but also a broad understanding of the role that the Organization should play in the creation of a better world. Moreover, your election is a recognition of the outstanding role played by Spain in the evolution of the world culture and the indisputable contribution it has made to the development of the norms and principles governing the conduct of nations in their mutual relations.

       "55  On behalf of the DominicanRepublic and its Constitutional President, Mr. JoaquinBalaguer, I offer to the President of the General Assemblyat its fortyninth session, Mr. Amara Essy, Minister forForeign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire, our congratulations on hiswelldeserved election.Likewise, our delegation pays a tribute of gratitude toAmbassador Samuel Insanally, for his stewardship of thework of the fortyeighth session of the General Assembly,and, especially, to the SecretaryGeneral of the UnitedNations, Mr. Boutros BoutrosGhali, who has dedicated allhis time and effort to ensuring full observance of thepurposes and principles enshrined in the United NationsCharter.My Government’s policy towards the pressing need fordevelopment is exemplified by the urgent efforts it ismaking on behalf of its people in the changing context oftoday’s world.Fortynine years ago, when the United Nations systemwas created following the end of a second major worldwide conflagration, the idea and hope prevailed of bringingabout a new world order that would exorcize the spectre ofwar and, once and for all, do away with war’s attendanthuman degradation and hatred.However, the victorious emergence of twoideologically opposed Powers led to the creation of abipolar international system that gave birth to the socalledcold war, marked by lateral confrontation and an arms racewhich, because of the everpresent possibility of directconfrontation, could have led to a nuclear holocaust and theannihilation of mankind.Thus it was that the General Assembly became thestage par excellence for the airing and debate of the mosturgent worldwide problems. While its politicaleffectiveness may not have met all the requirements ofpeace because of the structure of world power that hadprevailed since  it did achieve overwhelming successin the actions and programmes of its specialized agencies.Born to foster peace and security and to promotedevelopment, the United Nations was the fruit of the postSecondWorldWar era.

The ecological crisis threatens the majority ofour f lora and fauna. Global warming threatens coastalpopulations and small island countries. Uncheckedpopulation growth threatens to exceed the capacity ofnature to restore itself. We have witnessed a crisis of thevalues that have traditionally governed the behaviour ofhumankind. War and armed conflict threaten the rightto cultural, ideological and political diversity and ourright to live in peace and unity.Those of us who live in the developing countriesdid not cause the world financial crisis. As you know,the crisis was caused by the failure to use effectiveregulations in the international financial system andby the arrogance, greed and unbridled desire to amasswealth. In the context of the crisis, ageold debateshave resurfaced as to how best to tackle the crisis.Should we reduce investment in social protections forour populations? Or, on the contrary, should we bolsterinvestment, making anticyclical social investment policies into a springboard for reviving economies?And how do we measure poverty and development andrecognize the social...   \n",
       "57   At this traditional gathering all the peoples of the world converge to reflect once again on the ideals of collective peace and security and to renew our commitment to the principles and values governing the international unification which is enshrined in this Organization. It is therefore a great honor for me in these circumstances to address the United Nations General Assembly at its fortyfirst session. It is also a great pleasure to convey to you, Mr. President, and to the heads of delegation the greetings of the Dominican people and its newly constituted Government, freely elected by popular suffrage.This is an excellent opportunity to offer you, Sir, my congratulations on your unanimous election to the prestigious office of President of the current session of the General Assembly. My congratulations are also extended to the other members of the Bureau, with heartfelt wishes that the work entrusted to them will result in an understanding and solution of the many problems afflicting the international community and covering social, economic and political aspects. You may rely on the full support and cooperation of the delegation of the Dominican Republic. You, Sir, your country and your regional group deserve the signal honor of occupying the presidency of the General Assembly. Your outstanding personal and professional skills, as well as your extensive knowledge of the problems and issues affecting international life, and particularly those related to the interests of the developing countries, are a sound guarantee that you will conduct our business with wisdom and objectivity.We are deeply grateful to your predecessor, the distinguished diplomat Don Jaime de Pinies, a son of Spain  a country to which we owe many of the fundamental features of our culture and to which we are linked by unbreakable bends of friendship. He provided exemplary leadership during the debates of the very important Assembly session commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the United...   \n",
       "58  It is an honour for me to participate in this new session of the General Assembly and to address this illustrious Hall on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Danilo Medina Sanchez, President of the Dominican Republic.Since the founding of the United Nations years ago, my country has been deeply committed to the Organization’s mission of cooperation for peace, security and the development of peoples. This year, that commitment was renewed when we assumed a nonpermanent seat on its Security Council for the first time, despite being founders of the United Nations. That is, of course, a responsibility that honours and binds us. That is why, we have done our utmost since January to ensure that our contribution to the Council always involves the search for broad consensus, which facilitates decisionmaking and efficiency.As part of that work, at the beginning of the year, when we assumed the presidency, we organized an open debate on the impacts of climaterelated disasters and their negative effects on international peace and security (see S/PV.. That debate takes on new meaning in the current context, following the wave of fires in the Amazon and the recent passage of Hurricane Dorian, which left behind a trail of shocking damage and many victims.It should be noted that for us and our Caribbean region, the effects of climate change are real, visible and devastating, and threaten the very existence of our countries. In that regard, we are encouraged by the fact that SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres convened the Climate Action Summit to address climate action within the broader framework of the Agenda for Sustainable Development, which we were very honoured to attend. We agree with him that climate change is the defining issue of our time and a direct existential threat. We have also been particularly attentive to the regional agenda in matters such as humanitarian aid for Venezuela or the preparation of the new support mission to Haiti.We have little more than a decade left ...   \n",
       "59  Permit me to join others inexpressing, on behalf of our President, Mr. LeonelFernández Reyna, our heartfelt congratulations toAmbassador Jan Eliasson of Sweden on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at this historicsixtieth session. The Dominican Republic is confidentthat he will lead it in an effective and fruitful manner. Ialso express my gratitude to the SecretaryGeneral,Mr. Kofi Annan, for his most valuable contributions tothe strengthening of the United Nations as aninstitution. In addition, I wish to congratulate HisExcellency Mr. Jean Ping of Gabon and toacknowledge his notable work in leading the mostrecent session.This sixtieth session of the General Assemblyshould go down in history as one of the mostmomentous United Nations sessions. Proof of that liesin two areas of major significance on its agenda: first,accountability with regard to the degree ofachievement of the Millennium Development Goalsand renewal of the commitments made to achievethem; and secondly, setting out the course for reform ofthe Organization to adapt it so that it can addresscurrent challenging problems and guarantee theeffectiveness of its actions in order to ensure thedevelopment, freedom and peace of all the world’speoples.For nations such as the one I represent, theambitious agenda aimed at achieving the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by has become thekey governmental programme.What could be more important to smallunderdeveloped nations with scarce natural resourcesthan leading their people out of the socioeconomicabyss caused by poverty, poor health and the lack ofeducation and productive employment? No politicalaction is more urgent — at least not in the DominicanRepublic. Eliminating poverty in the world is amonumental task requiring unstinting politicalcommitment and the collective participation of allsocieties, as well as unlimited economic support fromthe developed nations.The heartbreaking realities of the present aremorally unacceptable in a world with ...   \n",
       "60  As we approach the second anniversary of the beginning of the worst catastrophe in almost a century, humankind has not yet been able to bring this terrible chapter of the coronavirus disease pandemic to an end. Nevertheless, we come to this forum with the hope of renewing and strengthening the bonds of cooperation and solidarity as fraternal nations.This community of States faces enormous challenges that can be effectively addressed only through renewed multilateralism. Indeed, in the face of pandemics, the climate emergency, the technological revolution and the need to articulate a new paradigm for the welfare state, it is vital to strengthen unity and cooperation among all nations.We have a historic responsibility to leave the world a better place than when we found it, but that is possible only if we take seriously the global transition towards a new ecological, sustainable, inclusive and equitable production model, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals of the Agenda for Sustainable Development. That change is possible only through a global and multilateral effort that guarantees the rule of law, human rights and the wellbeing of all peoples, leaving no one behind.Despite the unfortunate scenario created by the pandemic, our Government has promoted a free vaccination plan, the success of which can be seen in tangible results and telling statistics: per cent of the eligible population is fully vaccinated, approximately per cent has received at least one dose and more than per cent has received a third dose, with a case fatality rate of per cent — one of the lowest in the world.In line with our vision of shared responsibility to find a way out of the pandemic and because we have an inventory of vaccines that has allowed us to do so, we have donated, in a spirit of solidarity, some doses to other countries in our region, as we are convinced that we will be safe only once we are all vaccinated.However, although we have begun to emerge from the pandemic, ...   \n",
       "61  ﻿It is a very great honour for me to address the Assembly at its fortysixth session and to convey, on behalf of the Government and the people of the Dominican Republic, our sincere wishes for peace and the wellbeing of all the nations of the Earth.Allow me to express to Mr. Shihabi the congratulations of the Dominican delegation on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I have every confidence that his diplomatic skill and experience will ensure that our deliberations will be fruitful, will help to strengthen international order and make for an even more beneficial peace among all the nations of the world.I should also like to express our gratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Guido de Marco, for his competence and dignity, and for the manner in which he presided over the proceedings of the fortyfifth session.Moreover, I wish to express our greetings to Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar for his inestimable efforts as SecretaryGeneral of the Organisation. The dedication and the zeal with which he has discharged his lofty functions for nearly a decade, and the courage and devotion he has shown in remaining in the service of the ideals of the United Nations, have earned him high praise, which confirms the great esteem in which he is held by the nations of the world.My delegation is pleased to extend a very warm welcome on their membership of the Organization to the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People Republic of Korea and the Baltic Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Rather than use the time at my disposal to discuss other serious issues on the agenda of the Assembly. I feel it would be more useful to enlighten the Members of the Organization about another small problem that affects just two neighbouring countries, which are perhaps unique in the world, in that together they occupy a small island in the Caribbean Sea and have relatively similar problems.In our state...   \n",

His personal and professional qualities and his dedication to the path of diplomacy augur well for the outcome of the session.I also congratulate his predecessor, Ambassador Peter Florin, on the exemplary and impeccable way in which he presided over the fortysecond session. His work contributed greatly to the Organization good image. We also wish warmly to congratulate the SecretaryGeneral, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the successes he has scored thanks to his persistent efforts for international peace and cooperation, efforts that have been widely and fully recognized by all members of this world body. The Nobel Peace Prize given to the peacekeeping forces is the best testimony of what we have just said. The SecretaryGeneral report on the work of the Organization in addition to being a source of information of incalculable value for us all is a sure guide to follow in the various situations that exist in the interdependent world of today.As a member of the great Caribbean family I wish also to hail an exceptional Caribbean, the Ambassador of Barbados. Her intelligence and her hard work have earned her the appreciation of the international community represented in this forum, as shown by the support given to her candidacy for the presidency of the General Assembly.In referring to the Dominican Republic as a member of the great Caribbean family I am highlighting its geographical, political, economic and ethnic facts. For those same reasons, and out of a birthright, we are also part of that great thriving, generous, suffering reality, although a land aware of its effective capabilities, and I am referring to Iberian America.We hope that our island, as in the past, will be the catalyst in all ne...   \n",
       "63   One source of satisfaction afforded me bythis session of the General Assembly, Madam President, isthe significant fact of your election to preside over it. Thatfact is extremely encouraging for countries like my ownthat have struggled for many years, especially during theconstructive phase of our present constitutional Government,to give the status of women its proper attributes. Wetherefore celebrate as a victory of our own, in closeharmony with our beliefs, the fact that an illustriousrepresentative of the loftiest ideals of human justice andtalent has been unanimously elected by all Member Statesrepresented here. Under your enlightened guidance, the GeneralAssembly is embarking upon one of its most promisingsessions, at a time when the agenda before us includes itemsof the utmost gravity and importance. The supreme position you now occupy at the twentyfourthsession reminds us of the notable presidence ofanother eminent figure, Mrs. Vijaya Laksmi Pandit, whoconducted the eighth session of the General Assembly withthe same ability that we look for from you in view of youracknowledged experience and understanding of the problemswhich are a source of concern and disquiet to allnations. Despite our concern, it is encouraging to find that attimes such as these, when international organizations aresuffering the consequences of the unrest afflicting thewhole of mankind, a distinguished woman should have beenchosen to preside over the highest organ of the UnitedNations. At the last session of the Assembly this same honourfell to Mr. Emilio Arenales, an eminent Latin American,now deceased, to whose memory I should like to pay aposthumous tribute for the wisdom with which he guidedour activities on that occasion, and for the admirable andunflinching courage with which he faced adversity in thedifficult tasks he accomplished.

       "64  I should like in the first place, on behalf of the delegation of the Dominican Republic and of my Government, to congratulate the President most heartily on his welldeserved election as President of the twelfth session of the General Assembly and to express my delegation’s conviction that with wisdom and diligence he will bring our deliberations to a successful conclusion.Anyone who returns to this hall after some years of absence from the work of the General Assembly cannot but be struck by the spectacle of the new delegations from States which are now Members of our Organization.Two vitally important principles are reflected in this new development in the United Nations: first, the principle of universality and, secondly and equally important, the principle of the selfdetermination of peoples. If the United Nations is to achieve the purpose for which it was setup, namely to bring States together with a view to promoting peace and improving the conditions in which man lives, on the basis of a general concept that necessarily embraces the whole of mankind, it must cease to be the restrictive wartime coalition which it was at its inception and must steadily reduce the hazard and uncertainty surrounding the conception of the qualifications required of an existing political entity before it can become a Member State.Just as the exaggerated pressure of the different political ideologies which divide the world today invests some of the applications for admission to the Organization with an element of artificiality, so, too, the struggle for the principle of selfdetermination is being waged with varying success in the context of the atmosphere of conflict in which the fundamental purposes of the Charter are being achieved.Despite adverse circumstances in which the principle of universality is being debated, recent sessions of the Assembly indicate that in the long run the imperative requirements of international life will prevail over subjective interpretations of the...   \n",
       "65  I am greatly honoured to congratulate Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed AlKhalifa of Bahrain upon her election, the first woman from the Middle East, to preside over the work of the sixtyfirst session of the General Assembly. She has the great responsibility to promote dialogue and harmony in the midst of the spread of conflict throughout the world. Likewise, we wish to pay tribute to the SecretaryGeneral for his ten years at the head of this Organization and for his immense efforts to promote peacekeeping, security and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  In the interest of continuity in the pursuit of United Nations reform, so notably promoted by the SecretaryGeneral, our country wishes to reiterate its conviction that any reform must provide for greater democratization. We recognize the unquestionable accomplishments achieved during this process, such as the creation of the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. Notwithstanding, reform will be incomplete if it does not include reform of the Security Council, the body specifically responsible for taking political decisions within this Organization. It is our conviction that the Security Council must be expanded to make it more diverse and participatory, with the aim of ensuring more equitable regional representation and taking into account the regional and national interests that prevail in today’s world. There is also a need for closer cooperation between the Security Council and other important United Nations bodies, such as the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council.  One of the global issues of great concern to the Dominican Republic and other parts of the world is that of human security. We have observed with great consternation that there has recently been an erosion of domestic security in countries, leading to increased violence and criminality. That situation has, without a doubt, been fuelled by a combination of factors, among them drug trafficking, the illicit...   \n",
       "66  ﻿Mr. President, permit me first to express to you the congratulations of our delegation since the General Assembly has with discernment elected you to preside over this session, whose agenda includes subjects for study and decision that are of much importance for the States which make up the United Nations. We are certain that your wisdom and your experience will mean that our common endeavour will prevail, both in the search for just solutions and in the results to which our deliberations lead. It is therefore our hope that, guided by the values you represent, we shall be able, when our work is done, to say that the thirtythird session of the General Assembly made substantial progress and was able to dispel the intangible factors that have halted the advance towards a new policy of understanding and effective decisions in the difficult task imposed on us by the expectations of our times and by the United Nations Charter. We wish to avail ourselves of this opportunity to extend our most cordial congratulations to Solomon Islands on its becoming a Member of this Organization. We are sure it will make a positive contribution towards the building of a better world, a task to which we are all committed.The history of the Dominican Republic has been characterized by heroic deeds in the defence of liberty. In this difficult task, this is part of the contribution that American independence has made to the principles of democracy. Up to now we have been guided by and have followed those guidelines.We cannot say that after  when the Dominican Republic came into being as a free and independent State through the brave actions of a few, we have not had to rise up again because of the interference to which our national sovereignty was subjected. To these incidents must be added the fact of our political turbulence, which generated the implacable scourge of internal revolutions. Nevertheless, the ideals upheld with sacrifice and selflessness by the founders of the Republic re...   \n",
       "67  I begin my statement by conveying the apologies of our President, Mr. Luis Abinader Corona, who, for unexpected reasons resulting from Hurricane Fiona, which has severely affected several provinces of our country, was unable to participate in this important general debate.I cannot continue without first expressing our condolences to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as to the members and observers of the Commonwealth of Nations, on the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Her example of dedication to public service will be remembered forever.After a painful period, which left millions of victims, we are once again in this great setting, since, thanks to science, we have managed to overcome the worst effects of the coronavirus disease. But who would have foreseen that, in the twentyfirst century, the spectre of war would once again haunt Europe? It has been a severe test, and we will hopefully learn lessons that better prepare us for the challenges ahead.Those would be preventable situations if there were the will to work together to find answers to the pressing problems facing humankind. That should be clear to us by now because, in a globalized world, there are no borders when it comes to the effects of epidemics, conflicts and violence. Precisely because ours is such an intertwined world, farreaching goals always require “transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, as the theme of this session of the General Assembly aptly puts it.It is essential to recognize that this Organization needs major reforms to shake it out of the comfort in which it has been operating. It must be stressed that what is important to our countries is to consolidate a renewed multilateralism. As part of a substantive reform, the General Assembly must be given greater powers and participation in order to reduce the excessive use of the veto in the Security Council, especially when it comes to issues involving human rights violations and sup...   \n",

The United Nations has made a significantcontribution to preventing armed conflict, reducingtension, resolving differences, promoting negotiation andagreements, and encouraging tolerance and nonviolence.But in a world that is becoming increasinglycomplex in the wake of an era marked by bipolarconfrontation between two models of civilization, andwith the rise of a technological revolution that hascontributed to an accelerated sense of time, a reduction indistances and an increase in expectations, the UnitedNations must exercise renewed leadership in order toconfront this new set of circumstances which, while theyrepresent tremendous opportunities for the peoples of theworld, may also threaten their future.It is no longer just a matter of preventing war andconflict; that unavoidable task will always be expected ofthe Organization. The United Nations must ensure forevery human being on this earth a dignified, hopeful anddecent existence.Never before has the world accumulated so muchwealth. At no other time in history has humankind beenable, as it is today, to produce everything it needs in theway of food, clothing, shelter, communications a...   \n",
       "69   Permit me to begin. Sir, by taking this opportunity to convey to you the congratulations of the delegation of the Dominican Republic on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fortyseventh session. Coming from a region that is taking on a new dimension in the international community, you will no doubt take a realistic view of the major challenges posed by the world situation. You have firsthand experience of the transformations taking place in the world. You are thus superbly qualified to guide with composure the deliberations of the Assembly. We wish also to pay a warm tribute to the distinguished Saudi diplomat. His Excellency Mr. Samir S. Shihabi, the outgoing President, for his skill and for the fruitful results he achieved in his work. On the new international landscape, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the collapse of communism, the likelihood of a world war has vanished. But in many regions it remains possible that conflicts of an unpredictable nature could take place. Hence the international community should remain vigilant, because though it is true that the danger of nuclear war has disappeared, it is no less true that another menace is still with us, that of the continued quest, on the part of some countries, for technology for the production of nuclear weaponry, behind the back of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Agency deserves to be revitalized so that it will be able to work effectively in its efforts to prevent the proliferation of those terrible weapons. Mankind is still burdened with problems arising out of the socalled conventional weapons, which are becoming more and more destructive, and what is needed is a degree of international control to limit them. That would make available resources that, if properly used, could contribute to the development of the countries of the third world, which are already suffering because of heavy public debt and restrictive and protectionist measures impeding inte...   \n",
       "70  It is an honour to participate in the sixtyninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations by representing the people and the Government of the Dominican Republic. I wish to express my sincere congratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President at the current session. I wish to thank the SecretaryGeneral, Mr. Ban Kimoon, for the honour bestowed on our country by inviting us to participate in the Education First initiative. As I hope that he was able to note in his recent visit to our country, the priority that education is being given in the Dominican Republic is perhaps the best indicator of the new hopes springing up in our country. It is true that news of hope is especially valuable these days when it is not very abundant.Generally speaking, the times we live in raise major challenges for the mission of the Organization — preserving peace, encouraging development, making education and health the entitlement of all inhabitants of the Earth. As we are all aware, about six years ago, a crisis that began in the financial sector of developed countries quickly spread to all productive sectors and has affected the entire planet. The consequences of the economic shock continue to be felt and were translated into tens of millions of unemployed, millions of evictions and deep cuts in social benefits in our countries.The welfare State, the instrument which produced some of the greatest advances in development and security in history, was jeopardized. Today, we live the paradox of seeing how that ideal of sustainable growth and social justice becomes more fragile in the countries of origin, while it is being reborn in emerging countries.

       "70  [It is an honour to participate in the sixtyninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations by representing the people and the Government of the Dominican Republic,  I wish to express my sincere congratulations to Mr,  Sam Kutesa on his election as President at the current session,  I wish to thank the SecretaryGeneral, Mr,  Ban Kimoon, for the honour bestowed on our country by inviting us to participate in the Education First initiative,  As I hope that he was able to note in his recent visit to our country, the priority that education is being given in the Dominican Republic is perhaps the best indicator of the new hopes springing up in our country,  It is true that news of hope is especially valuable these days when it is not very abundant, Generally speaking, the times we live in raise major challenges for the mission of the Organization — preserving peace, encouraging development, making education and health the entitlement of all inhabitants of the Earth,  As we are all aware, about six years ago, a crisis that began in the financial sector of developed countries quickly spread to all productive sectors and has affected the entire planet,  The consequences of the economic shock continue to be felt and were translated into tens of millions of unemployed, millions of evictions and deep cuts in social benefits in our countries, The welfare State, the instrument which produced some of the greatest advances in development and security in history, was jeopardized,  Today, we live the paradox of seeing how that ideal of sustainable growth and social justice becomes more fragile in the countries of origin, while it is being reborn in emerging countries,  While developed countries adopt policies of austerity and structural adjustments, which are concepts sadly familiar to Latin Americans, we see how social programmes proliferate in different corners of the planet, lifting millions out of poverty and mitigating inequality, In the Dominican Republic, we s...

       "\"Had the United Nations not been faced in its five years of existence with countless obstacles, had it not been called upon to deal with so many alarming symptoms in the historical development of a convalescent world, it would be difficult to justify its creation, to welcome its birth and to hang on it, as men hoist a banner to a masthead, the hopes of peace and security of a profoundly disturbed epoch  The fact is that the struggle which this young yet already sorely tried Organization has waged, and is still waging, is the best proof of the timeliness of its conception and creation, and of the urgent and imperious need for the work it is doing today Certainly this has not been merely another episode in the political history of the peoples  The recent wars, with their unparalleled violence and enormous destructive power, engendered in the peoples a boundless desire for peace, concord and agreement  That is why the United Nations (united for agreement, concord and peace) neither can nor should be regarded as one of those familiar panaceas created for interested motives in international political laboratories with the object of providing temporary compromise solutions for more or less selfish problems; it must be recognized for what it is, a sacred idea conceived by the peoples at a time of grave and legitimate struggle for the permanent protection of their democratic existence, autonomy, dignity, peace and security For these reasons it is a crime to obstruct it in its sacred mission  It is a crime to try to reduce it to a tool of selfish ideologies  It is a crime to use it as an instrument of war in times of peace  It is a crime not to render it due honour “We the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war…” Thus reads the opening sentence of the Preamble of the United Nations Charter  Yet, today one of these nations, “determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” is violated and invaded by violent and brutal forces bent on extermination — the extermination of a people and of a nationality  I need hardly say that I am referring to the democratic Republic of South Korea In the degrading scale of interventions, unjust and injurious interventions by armed force marks the nadir below the zero of international politics  I belong to a country whose deepest and most prolonged historical afflictions have been painfully rooted in the most varied types of intervention  The Dominican Republic, with its experience of the martyrdom of intervention, is in a position to appreciate to the full the tragedy which the people of South Korea is suffering But what democratic people, even if it has itself never been the victim of treacherous aggression, can fail to have repudiated and condemn such an unprecedented and criminal outrage  The United Nations, composed of peoples which wish to be peoples, of men who strive to be men in the highest sense of the word, has taken on behalf of its Members the stand dictated in all of us by the deeprooted instinct of selfpreservation and the supreme and universally felt desire not to let foul aggression go unpunished By its energetic, resolute, unequivocal and united action, the United Nations has saved the faith of mankind in the principles of peace, and has taught the aggressors an eloquent lesson The blood now being shed by the American soldiers is redeeming the ideal of the United Nations — the ideal of peaceful possession and enjoyment of security  For the first time in history the community of nations has taken the decisive step of waging a victorious war on war  Never has such a tribute been rendered to peace, for never before has the conscience of mankind been so united in the face of brutal aggression  Let this object lesson serve as a formal warning to aggressors everywhere, whether they be violators of the national rights of others or merely ideological aggressors; for any moral aggressor is potentially a military aggressor The Dominican Republic takes this opportunity to reaffirm its intention to offer its full cooperation and, as far as its resources permit, to assume its full share of the sacrifices necessary for the complete triumph of this just United Nations undertaking  This is not the first time — let us hope it may be the last — that my country, though not one of the greatest or most powerful, has calmly and bravely faced an unequal fight for the right, resolute and conscientious in the performance of its duty Before leaving this rostrum I should like to refer to a different matter connected with the United Nations  The question of the relations between Member States of the United Nations and Spain was placed on the agenda of the fifth session of the General Assembly at the initiative of the Dominican Republic [A/ Apart from the reasons imposed by the logic of history and the irresistible force of tradition; apart from the historic heritage which has implanted in the soul of peoples a strong feeling of filial respect mingled with manly and honourable gratitude; apart from the fact that the Dominican Republic, as the firstborn, wished by its action to express a desire rooted deep down in the national instinct of some twenty sister countries; apart from all this, the Dominican Republic was guided by two more immediate and realistic considerations, more timely and practical, when it asked the General Assembly first to consider and later to approve the resumption of normal and traditional relations between Member States of the United Nations and Spain These two considerations are, first, the sincere desire to point out — so that it may be taken into consideration — that there has been a change in world public opinion in favour of such relations since resolution (I) was adopted on December  and, secondly, the fervent wish to contribute to this world Organization a new and constructive element of unity and agreement, an element which is the more necessary and desirable at a time v/hen gales, blowing from a quarter we all know, are threatening to strip the petals off this white rose of peace which is called the United Nations Charter The Dominican Republic trusts that it is not alone in hoping for the adoption of this constructive and just proposal which, just and constructive as it is, it has submitted as a tribute to United Nations unity  At the outset, I would like to congratulate Ambassador María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on her election as President of the General Assembly and to wish her every possible success  It is a great honour for me to be able to once again address the Assembly as President of the Dominican Republic  This is a special occasion for our country, because next year the Dominican Republic will sit on the Security Council as a nonpermanent member for the first time On behalf of  the Dominican people and myself,    I would therefore like to start by thanking the States Members of the United Nations for the support we have received in joining the Security Council  In particular, I thank the members of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States for the trust placed in us  Our purpose during our term will be to contribute a voice for Latin America and the Caribbean to one of the forums for greater  global responsibility  in   the   maintenance of peace Of course, we are committed to asserting, both in the Security Council and in the Assembly, the same unbreakable principles that guide us as a nation  Respect for human rights, democracy, freedom and diversity will therefore be the beacon that we will follow in order to guide our work in the Security Council  We will do everything possible to honour the trust placed in us, being fully aware that, although fragile, stability and security are priority objectives that must be preserved and progress made towards, step by step and day by day It is clear to us that in a space that addresses issues that can change the course of history and the fate of millions of people, we cannot seek easy and drastic solutions, which in any case do not exist  In that context, our country will always be a place of dialogue and understanding, and will always seek peaceful solutions  We are always willing to do whatever it takes to find common ground and support consensus as the best tool for peace and development  We will therefore always promote rapprochement among peoples through mediation and democratic dialogue, opening spaces for a future of shared peace Since its founding more than seven decades ago, the United Nations has played a central role in creating a more stable and secure world for human beings across the globe  However, we can never consider stability a definitive achievement  We cannot lower our guard when we know, for example, that in our Latin American and Caribbean region alone, per cent of the population belongs to the socalled vulnerable class and could therefore fall back into poverty when faced with any setback By the same token, it is fair to recognize that like so many other things, security is not well distributed  We all know that there are territories in the Americas and in many other places around the world where the prospect of living peacefully and without fear is an almost utopian vision, due to the control that organized crime exercises in those territories What can we do, then, to make this a more stable world  What measures can we implement to ensure that security is not solely the asset of a select few countries, but one that extends throughout the world and reaches every neighbourhood and village  Of  course,  I  am not the only one asking those questions — everyone here has asked them at some point — nor will I give definitive answers, which can be formulated and found only by working together  What I will do is briefly mention what I consider two of the main threats to global stability and security  I am referring to climate change and drug trafficking and organized crime At first glance, they may seem very different from each other, but their complexity and global scope makes them two of the main challenges  facing humankind  In both cases, the consequences are the destruction of thousands of families, collateral damage to all aspects of human development and the overwhelming of States by the magnitude of the challenges they face Let us start by talking about the consequences of natural disasters, which are occurring more and more frequently  We only have to open the newspaper or turn on the television to see the effects of climate change wreaking havoc somewhere on the planet  From thetyphoon that recently hit the Philippines, the strongest in decades, to the hurricane seasons that punish the Caribbean islands with increasing ferocity, no corner of the world is safe  Last year we saw Hurricane Irma leave Havana totally flooded, and it took many weeks for things to return to normal  Meanwhile, in Puerto Rico, Antigua and Barbuda and other Caribbean islands, it has taken months to recover from the effects of Hurricane Maria, which not only brought about economic losses but also claimed a considerable number of human lives In the Dominican Republic, we are strongly committed to dealing with the consequences of climate change  That means that we are working simultaneously on three levels of action, local, national and international  It is at the local level where people’s daily lives develop   It  is  there  that  tragedies  take on a painful reality and where the work of building, preparing and raising awareness must begin It is at the local and national levels where our Government has a greater capacity to act and where we are improving resilience and relocating the communities that live around our most significant watersheds, which are highly vulnerable to meteorological events   We are also doing a great deal of public awareness work and training thousands of  teachers  and  technicians to promote sustainable development in their schools and communities Then there is the national level, where  we  are also working tirelessly, both on our rapidresponse strategies and in the field of prevention  For instance, we are planting millions of trees across our country and investing more than ever before in renewable energy  Those measures will not only support our economy, they will enable us to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases by per cent by  a goal that we are very pleased about However, the fight against climate change is  a task for all of us, and that is why the next level — the international level — is the broadest and most essential of the three  If there is no political will in this area, most of our efforts will come to nothing and will have a negative impact on all the progress we  have  made  at the local and national levels  That is why I would like to reiterate once again before the Assembly the importance of going beyond good intentions and focusing on concrete actions Among those actions, I want to once again highlight the urgency of financing and making operational initiatives such as the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts, which will make it possible to compensate for the destruction of infrastructure and ecosystems and alleviate the threatening conditions of our residents  That fund is essential to ensuring that natural disasters do not destroy in a few hours what many nations have spent decades building I will give one example, on  the  understanding that our case is not the most tragic in the Caribbean region  Last year, the storms Olga and Maria spelled the destruction of more than $billion worth of infrastructure  Imagine what that means for a country whose annual State budget is already limited  Above all, the Warsaw fund will help protect the valuable lives of millions of human beings, bringing them peace of mind for their homes and granting them a future without a constant uncertain feeling of threat every time they see that rain is coming  We therefore consider it indisputable that those countries that have most heavily contributed to the gas emissions that are responsible for climate change are also those that should contribute proportionally to the  fund  established  to  mitigate its effects As I described earlier, we also consider drug trafficking and organized crime to be a threat to global security and stability of a similar magnitude to that of climate change  The trafficking of illicit substances claims  thousands  of  lives  every  year,  particularly of young people,  who  are  extremely  valuable  to our countries  As if that were not bad enough, drug trafficking also permeates our institutions, unbalances our economies, threatens our values and brings nothing but degradation and destruction to our social fabric  Wherever organized crime prevails, the security and peace of our peoples always deteriorate over time  As with climate change, therefore, the fight against drugs must be conducted at all three levels — local, national and international — in order to achieve effective results In the case of our country, local intervention is focused on prevention campaigns and educating our young people by supporting them with training and entrepreneurial opportunities, while also improving the neighbourhoods where they live and recovering public spaces for people to use  We do all of that with the aim of saving the most vulnerable populations from criminal networks At the national level, our security forces and national drug control directorate are  working  all over the country as part of a comprehensive plan to strengthen our actions against drug trafficking  Among other initiatives, we are acquiring new, hightech equipment and strengthening security at our ports and airports with more agents and security checks, as well as carrying out indepth interventions in areas with the highest incidence of crime  In parallel, we have moved forward with the enactment of a law against money laundering and the financing of terrorism, based on the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, with an emphasis on preventing and combating money laundering, which drug traffickers use to ensure the profitability of their activities Finally, at the international level, we have bilateral and multilateral agreements in place with the United States, the European Union and the countries of the Central American Integration System, as well as participating in the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, all with the objective of coordinating efforts and improving our efficiency in combating drug trafficking and organized crime  Thanks to such initiatives, we are better prepared to fight together against that evil, which threatens the integrity of our economies and our democracies  However, we must emphasize the need for greater international coordination We can make great strides forward if we join our efforts, share information and support each other in our work  We also understand that showing greater commitment is the responsibility of countries that due to their domestic demand for narcotics, have set in motion the international machinery of drug trafficking and organized crime  We  cannot ignore the fact that  it is the developing States that act as the first barrier in containing drug trafficking, thereby protecting the most developed countries Our countries allocate billions of dollars each year to fulfilling that role, but it is never enough in the face of the huge resources deployed by organized crime networks  That is undoubtedly a key factor in the social disintegration that many of our countries are dealing with  As in the case of climate change, it is the more developed countries with greater consumption capacity that must dedicate more resources, cooperation and political will if they truly wish to fight the problem with any hope of victory  In combating the effects of drug trafficking and climate change, we will address some of the structural causes of deeper poverty and social inequality  If the United Nations and the developed countries want to help fight poverty more comprehensively and openly, those two fronts are an intelligent, humane and cost effective way to do so  We once again appeal to those countries from this rostrum to show the responsibility and solidarity we need to make our planet a safer place Climate change, drug trafficking, poverty, social inequality and mass migration are all interrelated problems that we must deal with urgently  As we have pointed out today, the best and perhaps only way to do that is to act at all levels of response to the problem, so that the agreements we sign in a forum like the United Nations have a real impact on the lives of the people, and so that the needs of our peoples are articulated in their national and international institutions We must therefore all continue to act according to our capacities, without hesitation and with the same objective of creating a world that is increasingly stable, secure and developed, a world in which all men and women can carry forward their life dreams  That is the ultimate goal that the Dominican Republic will continue to work for  We will do it in our towns, neighbourhoods and all of our cities; with our immediate neighbours and with all members of the General Assembly; and in the Security Council next year, in the new role that we will be honoured to assume       May I begin my speech, Mr  President, by conveying to you on behalf of the delegation of the Dominican Republic our heartiest congratulations on your election to preside over the deliberations of this twentyfirst session of the General Assembly     These sentiments also express our conviction that you will guide our labours so wisely yet so firmly that we can even now anticipate the chorus of praise and recognition from the delegations here present at the success of your noble efforts, in the high position you occupy by the vote of this Assembly, to achieve peace and the solution of the problems facing us     It is not with empty words of vainglory or boasting, but backed by the exact not to say strict expression of historical truth, that I state that never in the history of the United Nations has there appeared before a meeting of the General Assembly a delegation of the Dominican Republic possessing credentials of such remarkable political value as those displayed by the delegation which I have the honour to lead     Born out of elections in which the Dominican people gave vigorous and unequivocal support to the programme of the victorious party in a contest whose legality and fairness were vouched for by impartial observers representing various trends of contemporary political and social thought, the Government of Mr  Joaquin Balaguer, which I have the honour to represent at this rostrum, embodies in the most positive manner the people aspirations for justice and progress and guarantees my country complete identification with the United Nation profession of faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person     As a fortunate result of representations made by the Dominican Republic in the Organization of American States, the InterAmerican Peace Force, stationed in my country as a sequel to the painful events which filled the Republic with grief and ruin, was withdrawn  My Government then approached the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations in order that the mandate of May for the despatch of a representative to the Dominican Republic might be duly revoked, since the free elections have fulfilled the basic aims of the Tenth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Organization of American States held in Washington on May  to solve within the American national ambit the grave political crisis then disturbing the Dominican Republic     The fundamental prerequisite for the existence of a state of law in a country has been satisfactorily fulfilled in the Dominican Republic  I can add categorically that this state of law is being progressively consolidated, even in the midst of the tensions which are only to be expected in the light of the tragic process of moral decline and decay of the State authority which has characterized the Dominican Republic recent struggle for existence     It is not enough to asset that a state of law exists in the Dominican Republic; we must also stress the feeling of real democratic coexistence which the present Administration is striving to imprint upon Dominican public life  Despite the impressive margin of votes obtained in the elections of June of this year, the new Dominican Government has not arrogated to itself, so to speak, a monopoly of the victor spoils  In accordance with its policy of political enlightenment, which it felt duty bound to put into effect on assuming a mandate which it had undertaken to exercise not on behalf of a political party but on behalf of the community, the present Dominican Administration is today joined in the enterprise of government with all men and women capable of contributing to the rehabilitation of Dominican public life regardless of their individual political affiliation     My Government believes that it is an essential requirement for domestic peace to accept the fact that we are a heterogeneous political society, the various sectors of which, far from being excluded, must on the contrary participate in the joint effort needed for the salvation of the country  Naturally, this recognition that all must share in the common task involves not only rights but also, and above all, duties and responsibilities  The delegation with which I share the proud duties entrusted to me is a clear reflection on this courageous and strict understanding of the exigencies of our national policy  Its representative character is guaranteed by the presence within it of a distinguished member of the Opposition in the National Congress and of important leaders and authorized spokesmen of other authentically democratic party forces     Nevertheless, the consolidation of the state of law is not the only fundamental preoccupation of the present Dominican Administration  We have also embarked with equal determination on the creation of a state of economic and social security, as is shown by the clear social trend of the new Government development plans; we are also improving public morality with the help of the disciplined sense of honesty and austerity which the new Dominican Administration has infused into the task of government     Important considerations affecting the maintenance of peace and security in the American continent will make it clear that the present Dominican experiment in democracy, because of the quality and intensity of the effort devoted to it, merits the sympathetic interest of the United Nations and in particular of those Powers which, within and outside the American continent, are making a genuine effort to create the conditions which are needed, in the words of the Charter, to promote throughout the world social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom     The alternative is fraught with the most catastrophic possibilities  If this experiment designed to initiate the Dominican Republic into the practice of civilized political coexistence were to be destroyed by the violent reaction of those who do not agree with this type of community, it would not be hard to prophesy that the legal vacuum thus created would be filled by foreign intervention or by a dictatorship which would crush public freedom and delay social progress  Thus we should suffer a permanent set back in our promising career as a nation endowed with resources enough to ensure it a prosperous and happy life     My Government greatly appreciates the spirit of international cooperation in which our efforts are being encouraged, and it has instructed me to convey from this rostrum our gratitude for the moral and economic aid which we are receiving from friendly nations  I should like in particular to refer to the decision of the United States Government to grant the Dominican Republic an increase in its sugar quota on the North American market, in all, an addition of about tons, which has had a most stimulating effect on the Dominican economy     The policy of financing the economic and social development plans of the developing countries will certainly be supported in the Dominican Republic by the strictest and most farreaching controls  Otherwise, the provision of international assistance for development purposes would be like trying to fill the bottomless cask of the Danaides     This means that we refuse, because we think it economically frustrating and morally humiliating, to go on stagnating as we were up to a short time ago, in conditions very like those of the colony of t«in Domingo in the days of its decline, when the lives of Dominicans were spent sadly awaiting the arrival of the galleons bearing the colonial subsidy     As President Ralaguer stated categorically when taking the oath of office on July  economic assistance used mainly to repair budgetary errors and correct omissions in the implementation of the Public Expenditure Act resulting from the administrative disorder in which we have been living is more of a disservice than an effective contribution to our programme to improve national institutions  In the face of this practice, the Dominican Republic has reversed its stand completely  We prefer aid which will help us to cease to be an economic parasite dependent on foreign aid  In short, the people of the Dominican Republic share the desire common to all worthy peoples and all honourable men, to earn a living by the sweat of their brow     The increase in the Dominican sugar quota on the United States market heralds a new era in the economic relations between the two countries  For the first time, these relations are being considered in a completely realistic light  Heartening prospects will open up, if this step, which is only the first along the right path, is consolidated and followed by other agreements of even greater potential for the prosperity of the Dominican Republic within its geographical area     From the Rio Grande to the Straits of Magellan, through the immense crescent of Central America and the Caribbean, we see profound changes taking place among a group of nations which have reached another crucial moment in their destiny  We see the awakening of human multitudes who were until a little time ago simply the pawns of history, but who now understand that they are in the front rank of those abstract conceptions known as States, which until recently were considered as being the principle subjects of law, geography and history  It can no longer be denied that the men and women of these lands — indeed, human beings everywhere — with their achievements, their miseries, their rebellions and their hopes, are the real concern of economics, law, education and politics     Evidence of the presence of the masses in the life of contemporary societies is copious and pressing  Latin America is no stranger to these anxieties and to the social problems of immense human communities ravaged by poverty  Sociological geography tells us that just as there is a geography of hunger there is also a geography of disease, a geography of ignorance, a geography, in short, of man’s inhumanity to man  It also tells us that there are, both at the national and at the international level in our continent, two Americas, which may be distinguished by names different from those on the map; one is known as the affluent society, the other the society of the dispossessed, and between them there is a failure of communication, a lack of interchange, that is reflected in a constant rise in the living standards of the former and a steady decline in those of the latter     In this situation, the peoples of America are faced with two alternatives; they can choose the brutal, leveling process of revolution, which is supposed to solve their social problems but at the expense of freedom; or they can find in the system of hemispheric cooperation the political and moral values, the procedures and standards, which, once brought up to date, will enable them to achieve by working together in the economic and social fields the objectives of the confederation of Bolivar, that sacred source of all our relationships     There can be no doubt that responsible opinion in the Americas has decided to opt for the second of these alternatives which responds to the imperatives of the history of the American people and to the concepts of their institutional life     The minds and wills of those who govern the Americas are inspired by a great ideal: the new plans for hemispheric economic integration offer the American peoples a future of unprecedented prosperity     The Dominican Republic shares in the legitimate interest awakened by these projects, the effective realization of which will be the start of a new epoch in American relations  At the same time it believes it necessary to make a number of comments on hemispheric economic integration in so far as it affects the situation of the Dominican Republic as a geographical and economic unit of the Caribbean region     The Dominican Government believes that, in view of the time already spent in considering the advantages of the rapid economic integration of the democratic areas of the Caribbean and in view of Dominican economic potentialities in relation to the neighbouring island of Puerto Rico, the time has now come to take decisive steps to that end  As President Balaguer said on taking the oath of office, Conditions are excellent for both countries to establish a kind of common market, and to organize their respective economies in a spirit of mutual cooperation  Santo Domingo could provide Puerto Rico with an infinite number of agricultural products which are not produced in large enough quantities by the latter, and both peoples could join together in many fields of economic development so that their combined capital could promote industrial development in the field of private investment     Twentyfive years ago, the distinguished Puerto Rican economist, Carlos Chardon, put forward in his book Viajes y Naturaleza some highly stimulating ideas which the passage of time has only made more cogent and compelling  In this work, it is argued that of all the groups of islands which exist in the world, only the Archipelago of the Antilles has been unable to achieve a socalled archipelago economy because in this group of islands there are seven sovereign Governments as far apart economically as they are geographically     Chardon says that the island region of the Caribbean may be defined economically as a typical food deficit zone apparently, a state of affairs which is growing worse because of the constantly rising population  This distinguished Puerto Rican scholar observes, however, that in this situation the Dominican Republic offers the characteristics of a country which, because of the diversity of its crops and its great potential for agricultural development, constitutes the natural supplier of food products to this geographical region     A study entitled Data which suggest the economic integration of part of the Caribbean area, prepared by Mr  Chardon for the Development Bank of Puerto Rico, was published in November  This admirable analysis substantiated the fundamental considerations that since have justified the plan, conceived in the terms I have briefly outlined  In this study, the author, after a detailed analysis of Dominican economic potential as compared with that of Puerto Rico, reaches the conclusion that of eight economic benchmarks seven are positive and one temporarily negative for the Dominican Republic, while for the island of Puerto Rico, two of these same benchmarks are positive and six negative  He therefore feels that the economies of the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico are complementary and that the two islands can achieve what he calls an unprecedented form of social symbiosis  According to the study in question, Dominican agricultural potential is twelve times greater than that of Puerto Rico  We may imagine what levels of production the Dominican Republic would obtain if its economy received the extraordinary additional incentive of integration within the triangle of freer trade relations with the United States of America and Puerto Rico     Recently, significant talks were held in Santo Domingo with representatives of Puerto Rican trade and industry, which constitute a beginning in the process of bringing the economic interests of the two islands together  It is obvious, however, that these talks must be supplemented by negotiations at the governmental level between the appropriate authorities, with a view to the conclusion of wideranging agreements covering all the matters involved in an economic merger equivalent to a common market,    Although the increase in the Dominican sugar quota on the North American market is undoubtedly highly satisfactory, this step should not be looked upon as temporary assistance to the Dominican Republic during what might be called its period of convalescence from the recent national crisis  The Dominican Republic hopes to find in the United States the necessary will to collaborate, in order to stabilize and develop its economic relations in the geographical area which it occupies jointly with the United States, bearing in mind the potentialities of its natural resources     The Dominican Republic has no desire to remain indefinitely in a state of complete dependence on external credit, no matter how generous the terms on which it is offered  Even in the midst of our present problems, the Dominican Government is determined to carry out its plans for economic rehabilitation and development by embarking on the difficult course of valiant effort and arduous sacrifice  Our aim is to achieve once more a healthy economy buttressed by the respectability of our democratic institutions which constitute its animating spirit  We are working not only for our own benefit but also in order to contribute as much as we can to the assistance of other peoples and to all the causes of social and humanitarian interest sponsored by the United Nations     The Dominican delegation has noted with interest that the agenda of this session of the General Assembly contains the item relating to the draft covenants on human rights  The preparation of these instruments is a most notable attempt to reconcile the contradiction between the vital interests of States and the universalist vocation of an international organization such as ours  In contemporary” international society, these instruments assume an extraordinary importance  They establish a higher tribunal, designed to humanize the function of government and ensure the international protection of human rights  This protective function is thus removed from subjective considerations of national policy which tend to distort it     We cannot but feel ourselves fully identified with the juridical technique adopted by the United Nations to secure the international protection of human rights  In ordinary situations, apart from those cases of grave and systematic violations of human rights which must remain within the direct competence of the General Assembly, the Dominican Government believes that the protection of human rights, whether jurisdictional or quasijurisdictional, should be entrusted to special bodies set up by virtue of treaties and conventions  Nevertheless, my Government’s attitude as regards the immediate effectiveness of these agreements is one of caution  We are aware that the European Convention on Human Rights of and its additional Protocol of  which must be approved and ratified by the national parliaments of the contracting parties, are still not fully effective in all their provisions and for all the Contracting States, although these instruments apply to a homogeneous political civilization  It can easily be foreseen, then that the United Nations Covenants on civil and political rights and on humanitarian and social rights will need still more time for complete and effective implementation     The Dominican Government has also noted with particular interest, among the social items on this Assembly’s agenda, that relating to a draft declaration on the elimination of discrimination against women  The presence of women in Dominican political and civil life on a footing of complete equality with men and their influence as a sane and conciliating factor in the political struggle has been so effective in the recent elections that women have gained positions in the governments of the twentysix provinces into which the territory of the Dominican Republic is politically divided     My Government also wishes to state that if there is any one violation of human rights which cries out in the sight of God and which must inevitably evoke in the conscience of the world the most overwhelming repugnance, it is that which perpetuates discriminatory practices on racial grounds  The Dominican delegation will strongly support the repeated condemnation of these practices by the General Assembly, practices that dishonour the nations which are responsible for them and which, far from making sincere efforts to eradicate them once and for all, stubbornly persist in enshrining them, as it were, in their political constitution     The Dominican delegation will also support any votes to censure adopted by this Assembly against manifestations of national and religious intolerance and will vote in favour of the speedy completion of the draft convention on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance     On behalf of the Government and delegation of the Dominican Republic, I extend hearty greetings to the new State of Guyana, on the occasion of its entry into the United Nations  I am sure that it will contribute to the realization of our Organization fundamental goals, and to that end we assure it of the Dominican Government desire to cooperate     As in previous years, the question of peacekeeping throughout the world is the most important general subject of our session     The Charter of the United Nations requires Member States to practise tolerance and to live in peace as good neighbours, as a means of attaining the noble aims of our Organization  To live and let live would undoubtedly be the most reasonable Corollary of that basic provision of the Charter, Naturally we would not go so far as to affirm with Menendez Pelayo, the author of La Historia de los Heterodoxos Espanoles” that intolerance is a state of health, but it is undoubtedly true that the world is witnessing a struggle between new orthodoxies and heresies which unfortunately we still have not only to live with but also to confront with needed definitions  Our real task is to reestablish certain values which cannot be regarded as the transitory concerns of a particular epoch, but are part and parcel of all that is most noble and essential in human nature  In these circumstances, peace cannot be regarded as a kind of Nirvana where the most virile and generous impulses of mankind dwindle into nothingness, for otherwise we would be admitting that all those provisions of the Charter which promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms would be no more than meaningless sounds or empty legal phrases     When socalled dialectical reasoning with its essentially relativist criterion of values and its cataclysmic interpretation of history maintains that irreconcilable conflict, the synthesis of opposing ideas through systematic violence, the occurrence of historical changes on the universal plane, are the only valid premises of international relations, it is clear that situations must arise outside the United Nations which cannot be reconciled with the principles upheld by our Organization     One aspect of peacekeeping in which the Dominican Government has a lively interest is that relating to the defence of democratic institutions, in so far as this concept involves not only economic and social values but also political and moral values which cannot be renounced  It is in the light of this conviction that we regard the struggle in which the heroic people of South VietNam are involved in defence of their freedom and security  As far as the Dominican Government is concerned, the support which the Government of the United States of America and other Governments in that area which are vitally interested in the preservation of democracy in South VietNam are giving to that nation has our confidence and merits our respect     Faithful to the interAmerican peaceloving tradition, to the creation of which it has made a distinguished contribution through its resolute and persevering support of compulsory arbitration and the peaceful settlement of international disputes in general, the Dominican Republic is aware of the wellfounded anxiety aroused by the situation in South East Asia, which moves all countries to deep feelings of pity     For all these reasons, it was with great satisfaction that we listened to the peace proposals submitted to this Assembly by Mr  Goldberg on behalf of the Government of the United States of America  In our opinion, they should be given careful consideration by those interested in peace with justice and dignity in VietNam     We appreciate and firmly support, as a duty not only of conscience but of religion, the enlightened efforts which His Holiness Pope Paul VI has been exerting for some time now to bring about an end to this war, the prolongation of which, in the view of many, may lead to unrestrained action which might aggravate the present international situation     We also want to add our good wishes to those which SecretaryGeneral U Thant has already received from our Assembly in recognition of his noble and untiring work for peace  His decision to continue at the head of the Secretariat of the United Nations gives my country particular pleasure     As a member of the American family of nations we cannot but reaffirm our attitude towards the decisive questions which are at stake in the VietNamese war for the basic causes of that terrible conflict are the same as those which may one day arise in America  They will have similar implications if we do nothing in the face of the systematic campaign to subvert American democratic institution  This campaign is encouraged and supported with every kind of material and psychological resource by a State which, having deserted the international community that nurtured the ideals and the forces to which it owes its very existence, now dedicates itself to the task of sowing the seeds of its madness through the length and breath of the Americas     The economic doctrine of laissezfaire, which led to the iron law of wages and which has been radically revised by modern economic thinking, must fail also as a political dogma  Instead of a United Nations resigned to the fatality of historical processes, we wish to see a United Nations valiantly determined to reaffirm the eternal values of human dignity and the selfdetermination of peoples, provided that the latter is not invoked to justify yet another adventure of tyranny and aggression  The systematic recurrence of certain items on the agenda of our General Assembly, such as those relating to the defence of peace against aggression, the struggle against racial discrimination and the last vestiges of colonialism, and the protection of human rights, demonstrate the unswerving will of our Organization to watch over these serious matters  This is the spirit which keeps alive the interest of mankind in this Organization whose profession of faith in these troubled times might perhaps be summed up in this motto of the founder of one of the smallest but most honoured constitutional monarchies of Europe: We need no hope to start the battle, nor victory to persevere  Mr  President, before beginning my statement on behalf of the delegation of the Dominican Republic I should like to express in this General Assembly the great sorrow which overwhelms the Government and people of the Dominican Republic at the tragedy which our sister Republic of Honduras is living through  Honduras which; in this period of its history, is making extraordinary efforts to achieve progress on the road towards development, at this time suddenly has to face the violent forces of destiny  There has been practically total destruction as though an apocalyptic hand wanted to plunge it into despair  But that is why we are all here, the sister republics of Honduras, meeting in this international forum so that we may here raise our voices and help in an effective manner the families which are at this time living through terrible anxiety  We express our solidarity with and condolences to Honduras The Dominican Republic, which takes pride in being one of the founding Members of the United Nations, has always paid its tribute of faith to the principles of the Organization, which have opened tip new horizons for an international legal order, the structure of whirs > as since its establishment resisted the onslaughts on the circumstances of life of peoples, is pleased to extend to the President of the General Assembly, Mr  Abdelaziz Bouteflika, our most cordial good wishes on his election, through the unanimous will of the countries represented here, to allow him to preside over this session and to guide us with his wellknown experience and wisdom in the tasks which await us We know very well that, as well as having eminent qualifications, he is a patriot determined to bring about the progress of Algeria so as to maintain in the forefront the prestige which it enjoys as a country which loves peace and independence, which has outstanding virtues and is concerned to see that the ideals and principles of the Charter will also contribute to the rule of peace and brotherhood among all peoples  Thus, our delegation is aware that your enlightened mind will assist us to find during this session the most correct solutions to the problems that we shall be dealing with under our agenda, and thus to fulfill the objectives laid down in San Francisco when the United Nations came into being Mr  President, we are certain that you too represent the continuity of that humanistic and universalist philosophy which has been represented here so brilliantly by Mr  Leopoldo Benites, an illustrious son of Ecuador, a man whose impact is already continental and universal In the course of the year that has elapsed between the twentyeighth and twentyninth sessions of the General Assembly, there have been negative international events which we have had to deplore and which have had repercussions on our Organization, the guiding genius in which the peoples that created it entrusted their major objectives for peace and universal solidarity Yet it is those very events which put to the test the principles of the Charter and the complicated mechanisms available for the attainment of the fundamental objectives  For that reason we must recognize that we must also be convinced that there have been positive events on which the task of the United Nations is nourished We must have the hope that the sanctity of nature which is approaching is the foundation of a new beginning, of a new history  Our motto from now on should be: we shall all work  Nothing could give us more encouragement than these wise words of the immortal North American poet Walt Whitman: If you don't find me at once, don't be discouraged; if I am not there, look for me elsewhere  I am waiting for you  Somewhere I am waiting for you All our peoples are convinced that since the State came into being as a legal concept propelled by the history of civilization up to the present time and since the beginnings of the concept of law, which in America goes back to the Sunday before Christmas in when in Santo Domingo the Dominican Antonio de Montesinos delivered a sermon in a church with a cane roof', a revolutionary sermon which he himself called a voice crying out in the wilderness and which the immortal Dominican humanist Pedro Henriquez Urena later called one of the great events of our spiritual history, these concepts have constituted the most astonishing invention which the mind of man could have created to ensure the survival of the human species despite all the destructive forces which very often have threatened to eradicate the little world we live in The certainty that we gain from these facts which history and philosophy teach us should be for us and for all the peoples represented in this Organization the supreme factor which encourages us even more to become stronger, to recognize that, while it is true that very often some events have aroused inevitable and convenient criticism and others have been viewed as signs of a weakening in the attainment of our fundamental objectives, it is no less true that in every case the principles have become stronger No one can deny that in this century of the atom the horror of war could lead to the destruction of the planet  Our Organization, far from remaining static although some of its principles have been violated in circumstances which have led some to believe in a crisis of the law has proved, as has been said, that: Development of relations among States in the world of today could not be conceived of without a universal organization of the scope of the United Nations  If the United Nations did not exist, we would have to invent it Because of changes in political thinking in a period in history in which our civilization is going through a transition which was already forecast by perhaps unexpected developments and which will change the face of the world, in past years we have expressed similar concepts in response to the quest for constructive solutions; among these we might mention the system of international security and defense The fact that we are witnessing quick changes in ideas which require profound revisions in the systems of law among States, and accordingly in the Charter, has been recognized lately, with great vigor and decisiveness, in the Latin American region Hence, the Organization of American States [OAS] in carrying out indepth studies which have led to drafts for fundamental reforms of the constituent instrument, which will be submitted to the fifth General Assembly to be held in April and to be preceded by the Consultative Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, to be held in Quito next November  That must be the point of departure for the revitalization and reorganization of the OAS, so that it may continue to serve as an effective instrument for the aspirations to peace, development and integration of the peoples of our continent  This means that in this forum too we have felt the vigorous onslaught of changes in structure which, although they have been correct and effective for a long time, have now been powerfully affected by the new facts of the international procedures, thus confirming the postulate that principles are nothing more than an emanation of necessity  The Latin American region can be proud at this time that it is testing with useful results at least so far an effective instrument which inevitably will be called upon to be more general in international relations  I am referring to the new dialog We would like to refer logically to the dialog that started in Bogota within the broadest framework of brotherhood and equality where, with great clarity and sincere frankness , the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Latin America decided to hold talks with the Secretary of State of the United States of America, Mr  Henry Kissinger, so as to seek by joint agreement all Latin America united, together with the United States the solution of the most immediate problems of the countries south of the River Bravo  This new dialog was continued in Tlatelolco, in the beautiful capital of Mexico, and later in Washington We can point with satisfaction to the spirit of Tlatelolco, as we have called this new dawn of a meeting of minds among Latin American countries, without claiming to lay down standards for other regions of the world, since other problems, such as those which affect other areas in Europe and Asia, may find in a similar policy legal, practical and honorable solutions such as permanent peace in the Middle East and a solution of the Cyprus case, to mention only two striking examples With regard to the Third World, it is no bold statement to affirm that one of the causes which regrettably affect respect for human rights, without involving in it the blind crudity of political passions, is forceful measures and the great dissatisfactions aroused by the underdevelopment of peoples, and this is cruder and rougher when it reflects unemployment and poverty which bring about a confrontation between the scant resources available to satisfy these needs and the impossibility of making those resources sufficient Thus we cannot fail to support, as we have supported in the past, in this General Assembly the need which cannot be postponed to give priority to the claims of the countries of the Third World  Even though it cannot be denied that progress has been made in that direction, we must frankly admit that in fact there exists no effective dynamic action for a frontal approach to the problem created by underdevelopment in more than areas of the world in so far as the jurisdiction of the United Nations extends  We therefore advocate the application in this field of the postulate whereby the developed countries of the world have contracted a natural obligation to contribute so that the countries of the Third World may more speedily attain development That is the policy drawn by the Charter of Algiers, where the matter was considered in its full, tragic consequences with the recognition, therefore, that it is an undeniable truth that the world of today gyrates around the economy, which is the axis which centralizes all constructive forces, on Which depend the inevitable and changing social developments of peoples, which are so personally linked to the economic developments* that there is not a single activity of social gathering or of man himself, individually, which does not depend on the economic tides which show the alternatives to our present civilization With regard to international progress, on the other hand, there are perspectives within the present international situation which lead to the recognition that there is a substantial advance towards progressively normalizing situations which have been of concern to States and peoples and which have prevented agreements which would facilitate and reduce to a minimum the causes that bring about a departure from the line of conduct drawn for permanent peace by the United Nations, within its legal order for all peoples It is encouraging to contemplate that some obstacles that had seemed to be insuperable have been removed from the road so as to bring about the essential reconciliation required by the concept of universality, which should govern an organization such as ours which already has welcomed more than sovereign and independent States and will receive into the world family more States in compliance with the principles of the selfdetermination of peoples and the total decolonization of the world, an event in relation to which all peoples can legitimately consider themselves to be brothers Because of the effectiveness which we attach to dialog, in an atmosphere of friendship and equality and constructive frankness, as a method which should be attempted more frequently in the new diplomacy, we have removed certain clouds which shadowed the prospect of a better understanding between the United States of America and the Soviet Union, as well as with the People Republic of China We do not believe that it is going too far to affirm that this has been the result of the fact that confrontation has been followed by a new and sound criterion of negotiation following the best course for men and nations, so that sooner or later all the rough edges which bar the way to international harmony may be made smooth Concerning the Law of the Sea, two years ago our country had the privilege to be the host for the Specialized Conference of the Caribbean Countries on Problems of the Sea  As the result of the deliberations of that important gathering, which was attended by all the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of all the countries of Central America and the Caribbean, a new instrument was drafted, called the Declaration of Santo Domingo 7The agenda covered many important aspects on that subject, among which we considered the territorial sea and the exploitation and conservation of marine species, as well as the regime for the seabed, within our joint geographical circumscription, and we also dealt with concrete aspects of pollution as the merciless enemy of marine fertility On that memorable occasion, the idea of the patrimonial sea was stated, the idea of exclusive exploitation not to extend more than miles starting from the base lines The results obtained were undeniably positive in effect, and they have had fruitful repercussions at the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held at Caracas in  on the fascinating subject of the wealth of the sea and its subsoil as a promising way out for the problem raised by shortages of food and of overpopulation, the projections of which are alarming everywhere in the world It was a fortunate coincidence that the Specialized Conference, held in Santo Domingo in  on the territorial sea, the continental shelf and exploitation of the wealth of the sea and related matters, suggested as a conflictive contribution the concept of exploitation, which was an advance over the doctrinaire formulations regarding horizontally and vertically as modules within which the rights of thecoastal countries adopted in in the Geneva Conventions should be regulated The Dominican Republic therefore has for decades been cooperating for the development and adoption of a new legal regime for the sea  It was with these convictions that we were present at Caracas, and while the Conference there did not arrive at a draft convention on this important subject, which involves the interests of all countries equally, it is no less true that it will make it possible to arrive at final formulations on the points on which no agreement was reached at Caracas, particularly in respect of the criterion of the Dominican Republic that major industrial installations on narrow straits must be the subject of negotiations so as to contribute to the prevention of any kind of pollution Concerning new States, when we consider the perspective offered by the continuous growth of the United Nations, we must rejoice at the fact that the prophecy that we would arrive at the universality desired by its founders, made when it took its first steps in an uncertain world, has been fulfilled We also recognize that this decision on the part of the new States to become Members of the Organization shortly after achieving independence is an unequivocal sign that the Organization is moving forward and that its instruments are effective for the attainment of its objectives, despite changes which occur internally in States and internationally With these convictions, our delegation is pleased and honored to welcome Bangladesh, Guinea Bissau and Grenada  We are certain that, as they were able to win independence, so they will be able to share the common responsibilities of all States Members of the United Nations I turn now to Panama  It is of great benefit to America that, after the meetings of the Security Council held in the city of Panama, where all the Latin American countries supported the position of Panama in its claims for a revision of the Canal Treaty, and after the visit and the dialog with Mr  Henry Kissinger, negotiations have been started in a spirit of friendship, mutual equality and respect  This is a step forward towards the changes proclaimed in the last international meetings in the Latin American region  America has started what we have called the new dialog, which we are taking advantage of only to implement, through a practical, coherent and harmonious system and in accordance with the most deeply felt needs, of Latin America, the plans and projects which we need to face the reality of our own situations  To speak now of a policy for accelerated economic development: at this very hour the countries I of the world are meeting in the highest of the inter' national forums and come here loaded with beautiful illusions and with a series of beautiful formulas backed by arguments which are profoundly convincing but often difficult to translate into reality, and require that at this time we frankly and honestly put a stop to the uncontrolled outpouring of projects, plans and programs, many of which have failed to provide the expected results We are going to make a sincere suggestion to the countries that are gathered here, particularly to the countries of Latin America  Basically we suggest that we should seek a mechanism or the mechanisms necessary for the true, ultimate development of our peoples In these times much is said about the population explosion, which has given rise to great discussions and important meetings, such as the World Population Conference held at Bucharest from to August  FAO met in Panama not long ago to speak about the need to increase agricultural production  In Yugoslavia, from to of this month, the second roundtable was held on agroindustry  Much is said of the need to obtain investments for the principal industries and, above all, much is said about the energy crisis and about inflation as one of the problems which have absorbed all mankind in recent times We cannot deny that the apparently disproportionate rise in prices brought about by the petroleumproducing countries lies at the root of the disconcerting runaway inflation which shakes to its very foundations the culture of superconsumption and the relative prosperity maintained up to now  The drama of the situation is clear when we compare the prices of some commodities: a metric ton of corn in cost $ in January it rose to $ The price of wheat which, In large measure, is a world food staple, rose from $per metric ton in to $in January  Rice, which is one of the products of highest consumption in the underdeveloped countries, rose alarmingly from $per metric ton in January to $in January of this year The ominous consequences of this dramatic economic process have had the most catastrophic and desperate impact on the poorest countries, where hunger and malnutrition have killed millions and millions of human beings and will do vast harm to future generations, since the infant mortality rate of the poor countries attained its highest point during the year  which surely history will baptize the year of malnutrition and human wretchedness Despite these tacts, we realize that the process seems to be irreversible  That is why we are convinced, and we wish to make this known to this Assembly, that the means of solving our problems is the rational and intensive exploitation of our soil and at the same time the industrialization of its products, our goal being to attain maximum productivity This policy will of necessity lead us to use the most modern agricultural tools and equipment and the most advanced technical methods in the administration of production, industrialization and marketing programs for agrarian products and, together with agrarian reform, would complement the integral development of Latin America It is necessary to incorporate into our development plans the concept of agroindustry, which calls for industries to be established where; agriculture is being practiced, so as to bring to our agricultural peoples not only the possibility of taking part in enterprises which would ensure them a fixed income, social security, bonuses, oldage pensions, and so on, but also an opportunity to educate their children, to change their habits and to raise their standard of living, which bears no comparison with the standard of living of the urban workers, who enjoy high salaries and relative equality of opportunity This policy is different from the policy of import substitution, which leads to an industry without a capacity for innovation and is always underdeveloped  It obliges economic integration to start with microeconomic units forming part of a harmonious scheme, until they can be molded into a single body able to generate the necessary energy to satisfy every need with the greatest possible social justice  It would furthermore be a rational method of halting the great migration of people from the rural areas to the urban centers, attracted by the illusion of a nonexistent industrial development It has been said that an integrated agroindustry is a modern enterprise aiming to industrialize one of the most ancient and most important activities of mankind  Hence it is not new; it is the clear and objective definition of its goals that is new, as is also the certainty that it constitutes an effective and fundamental mechanism for a genuine solution to our problems The world is today facing one of the gravest crises ever recorded in the history of mankind, and that is the disproportion between food production and world population growth  There are even large areas of the world where agricultural production has decreased substantially in the past years The essential reason for this almost general deficit in agricultural production is  fundamentally based on the lack of a clear policy which would motivate man and lead him to work his soil in the social conditions required by the world today, such as the technology, the training and administration, the financing and marketing, so that the optimum yieldmay be obtained from the soil It is no accident that cane sugar was, has been and will continue to be one of the main substances of the economic process of the Dominican Republic, and that the manner in which it is sown, harvested and processed is industrial, with a high degree of technology this is one of the spheres where man has been able to produce raw materials at the lowest prices  Cane sugar and its industrial processing constitute a powerful agroindustry in many of our countries, which allow for effective agricultural and industrial yields for the economies of our people The man in the field must have in his hands the necessary means to extract the highest yields from nature  Nature, which is wise, has always had its own mechanisms, and since the very beginning of mankind there have always been, although not in the dramatic proportions of today, population growth and production deficit  And today all that we men have achieved has been to create some of the necessary elements for a precarious subsistence for the vast majority of our peoples That is why we make an appeal from this international forum so that all countries, and in particular the Latin American countries, may consider the adoption of this policy, since Latin America is the area of the greatest hope of the world  It is the area of the world which is least exploited, where the land has not yet been worked technically, where the man in the field constitutes per cent of our population of million inhabitants today, and it is the region that could become one of the most productive areas of the world Regrettably, so far most economic policies in our area have been circumscribed to the mere subsistence of the individual  Few times and in few countries has any thought been given to or action taken of heroic proportions to face our ills We are totally convinced of the effectiveness of the system of agrarian reform, because in our country, which has a territory of barely square kilometers, in the last eight years, under the administration of the constitutional government of Mr  Joaquin Balaguer, thousands and thousands of families have achieved a substantial increase in their agricultural production  But if we were to create the concept of the manager of the field and make of it a reality, a manager and man from the city in the field, possibly the social mutation that would occur in our countries would have highly positive repercussions for future generations, because if the man of the city were to go to the field and set himself up with a large enterprise, in a constitutionally legal manner, as was done in the Dominican Republic, the land would become the property of the one who cultivated it, with laws for minimum salary, social security benefits and other kinds of benefits for workers in the field, like the treatment accorded workers in the city; then migrations towards urban centers would be reduced and small countries, such as mine, for example, could relatively easily become societies where all the men who work in the field, would have electricity, television sets, refrigerators and all the advances of modern times, together with fresh air and the beauty of nature Obviously the State must provide these managers with the necessary resources, such as the required infrastructure, so that the execution of these projects follows standards of productivity, with a minimum of expenditures, as incentives for the development of managerial skills of this kind It is also vital for international institutions such as the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank to intensify their actions so that this type of undertaking may serve the purposes sought Two decades ago the world had an eminently political criterion  Today the criterion is eminently economic  The most obvious proof is how world policy has changed because of the surprising rise in oil prices and the under development of such countries as Brazil and Venezuela, which have now attained some of the highest production levels and some of the highest standards of living ever recorded in their history by those great and powerful South American nations Most of the countries of Latin America have suffered a great ill, and there is no more important forum than the General Assembly of the United Nations for us to carry out our own selfcriticism  And this great ill is the legendary tendency to live by asking for help from the powerful, at a risk of undermining the selfdetermination of our people, to find ways for the powerful to help us, while we maintain an attitude almost of indifference, and not just of collective irresponsibility, expecting others to do things for us, instead of facing our problems with our own intelligence, our own resources and our own means The world of today and absolutely no one disputes thisis made up of a series of independent States with interdependent economies  It is now clear that all the key economic factors must be assessed, both in relation to their national repercussions as well as their international repercussions  It is only in our times that the world leaders seem to have become fully aware of the importance of what has been called economic interdependence  As an expert on economics at Harvard University, Professor Raymond Bermond, said: Suddenly sovereign States feel naked  Concepts of national sovereignty and a national economic potential seem to be curiously lacking in meaning We wish to emphasize that perhaps the most curious aspect of this new development of interdependence is that the reactions that have been aroused have followed no foreseeable standard  Few developed or developing countries seem to know how to deal with this  Some consider this as coercion and others consider it as an opportunity  But there is complete agreement only in assuring that interdependence is a fact and that it would seem that in certain circumstances it may represent an unprecedented opportunity for development and prosperity However, we cannot ignore the fact that, unless we achieve genuine and integral development in our peoples, interdependence will come to an end, and we shall go back to the humiliating and anachronistic dependence which violates the most elementary 'principles of the integrity of our State To strengthen this thesis and so that we may be conscious of the fact that all that we have stated here is absolutely feasible, we need do no more than read articles  and part of of the Charter of the Organization of American States, as amended by the Protocol of Buenos Aires, of February which state the following:Article  The Member States, inspired by the principles of interAmerican solidarity and cooperation, pledge themselves to a united effort to ensure social justice in the Hemisphere and dynamic and balanced economic development for their peoples, as conditions essential to peace and security Article  The Member States pledge themselves to mobilize their own national human and material resources through suitable programs, and recognize the importance of operating within an efficient domestic structure, as fundamental conditions for their economic and social progress and for assuring effective interAmerican cooperation Article  To accelerate their economic and social development, in accordance with their own methods and procedures and within the framework of the democratic principles and the institutions of the interAmerican system, the MemberStates agree to dedicate every effort to achieve the following basic goals:(a) Substantial and selfsustained increase in the per capita national product;(b) Equitable distribution of national income;(c) Adequate and equitable systems of taxation;(d) Modernization of rural life and reforms leading to equitable and efficient land tenure systems, increased agricultural productivity, expanded use of undeveloped land, diversification of production; and improved processing and marketing systems for agricultural products; and the strengthening and expansion of facilities to attain these ends;(e) Accelerated and diversified industrialization, especially of capital and intermediate goods;(f) Stability in the domestic price levels, compatible with sustained economic development and the attainment of social justice;(g) Fair wages, employment opportunities, and acceptable working conditions for all;We are aware that the analysis that we have thought agroindustry deserves does not require so much attention by the countries which, benefiting from the wealth of the subsoil, have been able to make up for some of the poverty with other structures where an extraction industry mobilizes large amounts of capital and thereby have obtained an accelerated course towards development and selfsufficiency If we, the peoples of America, are to achieve and bring to a happy conclusion and concrete reality the programs for agricultural development and industrialization, we shall all of us see our efforts crowned with glory and the efforts of those illustrious statesmen who, with their brave deeds and their glories and the courage of their peoples and the firmness with which they have brandished their swords, gave us our freedom and thereby the right to go on promising and attaining the establishment of a just society where slavery will never exist, nor servility nor dependence On behalf of my delegation, permit me to pay a tribute to peace, which is the supreme objective of the United Nations, on the MQittient of whose principles the destiny of mankind depends more than ever today  Peace is all the more hidden when we most seek it  It most hides when it is best loved  It is most confused when it is nearest  It is most sacred When it is distant  It is most radiant when it is denied The great geniuses of political thinking of antiquity and of modern times have tried to define peace within its philosophical vastness  Let me here, however, simply state the theological thinking of St  Augustine, who said:The peace of men is orderly concord; peace at home is agreed uniformity among those in authority and those who obey and live in it; peace in the city is the orderly concord of citizens and neighbors in ruling and obeying; peace in all things is tranquility in order, and order is nothing more than a disposition of equal and unequal things, which gives to each its proper place   May I first of all on behalf of theDominican Republic and on behalf of its ConstitutionalPresident, Mr  Joaquín Balaguer, express our sincerestcongratulations to the President of the fiftieth session ofthe General Assembly Secondly, I wish to express our profound gratitudeto the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic ofCôte d’Ivoire, His Excellency Mr  Amara Essy, whopresided over the fortyninth session and, particularly, tothe SecretaryGeneral, who, by his extraordinary effortsand tireless dedication in a world marked by challengesand breaches of the peace, wages a daily combat for thefull implementation of the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter The Dominican Republic can affirm with pride onthis fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the UnitedNations its role as a founding Member of the UnitedNations, which signed the San Francisco Charter withinthe international order that rose from the ashes of theSecond World War, whose fiftieth anniversary we alsocommemorate, and as a country that defends the principleof sovereignty as the inalienable right of the people Fifty years after the creation of the United Nationsin  the world is in a state of transition toward whathas been termed a new world order, moving frombipolarity to unipolarity in a multipolar world, followingupon the world built in Yalta and in the Bretton Woodsagreements The order was based on a balance of powerand on the United Nations as a reflection of the realdesire to seek security and universal peace — and theOrganization has managed, since its creation, to avertanother nuclear holocaust General Assembly d plenary meetingFiftieth session October Small countries such as the Dominican Republic,staunch guardians of their national sovereignty, havewitnessed during the five decades since this ordercreated through the United Nations and its specializedagencies, with Bretton Woods, the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO), the Council for Economic Aid(COMECON), the Warsaw Pact, and the EuropeanEconomic Community — today the European Union; theevolution of countries with market economies and thosewith centrally planned economies, and the decolonizationprocesses which have resulted in the establishment of manyindependent States  All this has left an indelible imprint onthe annals of contemporary history and has been rich inlessons for all the nations of the world — lessons, in aword, on relations between North and South The order which emerged from Bretton Woods wasreflected in the International Monetary Fund (IMF); theInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development(IBRD); and the aborted International Trade Organizationof  which was replaced by the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT), from which the agriculturalsector, services and intellectual property were excluded  Allthis explains why years later, with the Uruguay Roundof Multilateral Trade Negotiations and the birth, in  ofthe World Trade Organization (WTO), we are givingmultilateral shape to world trade in order to overcomebilateral barriers and, above all, the protectionism that waspractised by the industrial countries In these five decades, the small countries had tostruggle mightily to uphold the principles of democracy,including respect for human rights, and to defend their rightto access to the markets of the industrialized countriesagainst tariff and nontariff barriers, quotas, and downwardspiralling in the prices of their raw materials  We can,however, point with pride to the way we fought for ourdemands for greater symmetry and fairness in commercialand economic relations  This in the end led to theestablishment of the United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development (UNCTAD) The San Francisco Charter illuminated like apowerful beacon the road to the future of the countries thathad had to experience the difficult period of the bipolarworld  For its part, the Dominican Republic, committed asalways to the principles of the Charter, was able to attainthe functional democracy we enjoy today  This took placewithin a world that has some integration processes andhas seen the emergence of three strong economicintegration blocs with their spheres of influence — such asthe European Union and the North American Free TradeAgreement (NAFTA) — in addition to the Free TradeZone of the Americas, which will probably be establishedin the year  and, for Eastern Asia, the AsiaPacificEconomic Cooperation Council (APEC)  There are alsothe political repercussions these processes have had on aworld where the dreams for centrally planned economieshave faded  Our country is now a member of the recentlyestablished Association of Caribbean States (ACS) This new world order that has now become theglobal village foreseen by Marshall McLuhan, within aglobalized, international economy, will not be withouttensions, for we do not yet fully grasp the culturalplurality of nations and the strong search for identity inregions and within ethnic and religious groups  Contraryto the popular phrase, history has not come to an end  Anew process is beginning with the expression by peoplesand regions of their national identity The globalization of trade would seem to transcendthe borders of the nationState and create a concept of aregionState, given the fragmentation of nationalaggregate assets Within the family of nations we feel proud to havebeen not only one of the States that participated in theSan Francisco Conference, but also one of the first tohave ratified, in resolution of our National Congress,the Charter of the United Nations, which was promulgatedby our Executive Branch on August On the fiftieth anniversary of that memorable datewe wish to pay tribute to those members of theDominican delegation who signed that historic document:Manuel Peña Batlle, Emilio García Godoy, GilbertoSánchez Lustrino, Tulio Franco y Franco and MinervaBernardino  We are a nation deeply committed to theproper functioning of democratic institutions, havingattained a commendable political stability in ourcontinent’s community of nations In this context, the United Nations will be making apraiseworthy contribution to the process of maintainingstability in our country by responding to the request ofthe Dominican Republic for reimbursement of the fundsspent in implementing the economic embargo imposed onour neighbour, Haiti  The Dominican Republic hassubmitted that request to the Secretariat and ourGovernment is now awaiting a response As a developing country the Dominican Republicmust face many challenges in the sensitive areas of drugGeneral Assembly d plenary meetingFiftieth session October trafficking and drug consumption  This is a problem ourcountry has met with a State policy that provides for severepunishments for offences related to this crime againsthumanity  At the present time legislation is pending in ourNational Congress to punish moneylaundering, which is anactivity related to the criminal drug traffic  We are alsocoordinating our policies with the international community,since in this field more than any other internationalcooperation is required It is fitting here to congratulate the United NationsSecretariat on the successful holding of the Fourth WorldConference on Women at Beijing  That Conferencerepresents a milestone in the Organization’s history becauseof the recognition it has granted to that noble human beingwho makes up half of all humanity and is the mother of theother half In that connection we would reiterate at this fiftiethsession, just as we did at the last session, our concern at theSecretaryGeneral’s proposal to merge the InternationalResearch and Training Institute for the Advancement ofWomen (INSTRAW) with the United Nations DevelopmentFund for Women (UNIFEM)  The General Assemblyshould recall Economic and Social Council resolutionof May  which established the permanentheadquarters of the Institute in the Dominican Republic We wish to reiterate — with the utmost courtesy, butalso with the utmost firmness — our request thatINSTRAW and UNIFEM not be merged, maintaining thecommitments contained in General Assembly resolutionof December and the agreement thatestablished INSTRAW in Santo Domingo so that our firstcity of America may remain the headquarters of thatimportant Institute  This would also be in keeping with theextraordinary importance of the recently concludedConference on Women We are now only six years from the beginning of thetwentyfirst century, in the year  and our thoughts turnto an assessment of the past years since the founding ofthe United Nations  We should also be visualizing thefoundations and the shape of the new world order for thebuilding of a future based on security and world peace This will require a qualitative change in the United Nations,removing the sacrosanct aura surrounding the veto power ofthe great Powers in the Security Council and promoting ademocratic system of coexistence among States andpeoples The United Nations and we, its Member States, willhave to meet the challenge of the demographic or socalled population bomb with growth estimated at million persons per year, and related problems, such asthe fact that in only per cent of the world’spopulation lived in rural sectors and over per cent inurban centres of over inhabitants  The number ofpersons suffering malnutrition is estimated to reach million by the end of the century  Children withoutschooling will number million, and there will be million illiterate persons  Those living without sanitationsystems will reach million  Dealing with thoseproblems will be a real challenge The new context of the world order will require athreepronged approach involving an ecological response,a political response and an economic response Although the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme was an important step forward for theprotection of the biosphere, consideration should be giventhe possibility of creating, after proper study, anecological response embodied in a United Nationsenvironmental security council composed of MemberStates with a permanent member executive committeeand a secretarygeneral with executive powers The political response would come from the reformof the United Nations Charter  In this connection, weshould bear in mind that Article of the Charter,which was written in  provides for the convening ofa General Conference within a year period for thepurpose of reviewing the Charter  In addition, on Aprila number of former Heads of State and politicalleaders appealed for a renewal of the United Nations Today, it is appropriate to envisage the inclusion ofGermany, Japan and India as members of the SecurityCouncil, as well as the inclusion of representatives ofthirdworld countries Charter reform would, of course, imply the exerciseof the powers of the SecretaryGeneral supported byundersecretaries for environmental, political andeconomic affairs In addition, the economic response should comefrom a clear and precise definition of the role of theUnited Nations within the new order  Since, in theeconomic sphere, the Group of has already beencoordinating its policies through a kind of securitycouncil, with the recent addition of Russia, we mightenvisage its incorporation into the United Nations as aGeneral Assembly d plenary meetingFiftieth session October sort of Economic Council that might include, in addition,the countries of southern Asia and the Pacific, as well asLatin America and other regions  It could eventuallybecome a Group of  linked to the General Assembly, theEconomic and Social Council, the specialized agencies andthe regional commissions The Dominican Republic hopes that the ideas andsuggestions that have been put forward, many now understudy and being proposed in various forums, will be viewedas a goodwill contribution by a small nation — a nationthat is small but proud of its participation in theinternational community For that reason, we cannot, as a small nation thatbelieves in unity within diversity, fail to mention oursupport for the agenda item — proposed by Burkina Faso,Costa Rica, Dominica, Grenada, Guatemala, GuineaBissau, the Solomon Islands, Nicaragua, Niger, Panama,the Central American Republic, Saint Lucia, SaintVincent and the Grenadines, Swaziland and our country,the Dominican Republic — regarding the special situationof the Republic of China in Taiwan in the internationalcontext, based on the principle of universality and inaccordance with the established model of parallelrepresentation of divided countries in the United Nations The Republic of China on Taiwan, a FoundingMember of the United Nations, has a population ofmillion, a high level of economic development and fullpolitical democracy  It has been a model to all developingnations  Its aspiration to participate in the United Nationsonce again is something positive for the internationalcommunity  The Organization must not ignore itsexistence  The Dominican Republic supports theestablishment of an ad hoc committee to seek asatisfactory resolution of this matter At this fiftieth session, the General Assembly shouldtake stock of the achievements of the United Nations inits years of existence as well as of the unfulfilledobjectives in the area of the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  But above all it should adopt a visionof the future that will enable us to build a democraticsystem of coexistence among States and peoples, inspiredby the profound human aspiration to lasting peace  Maymerciful God help us attain these goals   At the close of the seventh session of the General Assembly, all the peoples devoted to international order, freedom and prosperity felt a deep satisfaction based on the heartfelt hope that, with the signing of the armistice at Panmunjom and the tangible results achieved there, there had been ensured not only, the final cessation of hostilities in the martyred land of Korea but also the initiation and success of negotiations that would lead to the speedy restoration of peace in that country, which had suffered premeditated aggression at the hands of governments whose goal was world domination by violence and hatred, in full accordance with the baneful purposes of international communism For the vast majority of the member States of the international community, and especially for the small countries like the Dominican Republic, the success of the action undertaken and sustained by the initiative and under the auspices of the United Nations in defence of right and justice has shown, at the cost of' indescribable suffering and sacrifice, the urgent need for organizing and putting into effect a powerful system of defence of the international community, based on the requirements of collective security If it is possible to single out, among the essential purposes of the United Nations Charter, one that can be considered as most important, it is that which requires that the moral force of justice should be constantly strengthened by the categorical and effective warning that the days when might was right have gone forever  Thus the United Nations is based on the outright condemnation of aggression and violence, and on due submission to the principles and rules under which the life of the international community is organized and developed  The Charter is, in short, the triumphant proclamation of the values of the spirit as against the schemings of force and materialism which bring in their train destruction, poverty, suffering and death It is, then, in no way surprising that the whole of that memorable international instrument, the Charter signed at San Francisco, which was destined to mark the birth of an era of security, wellbeing and dignity for individuals and for nations, is plainly based on the paramount principle of good faith which must govern human relations in all their aspects and which, as was taught by a jurist of ancient Rome, imperiously reminds us of our essential obligation, based on law, to keep our word and our promises Unfortunately, certain governments, dominated by the communist ideology, do not respect the purposes and principles of the Charter as they should, and this has frequently led them to resort to subversion, violence and aggression as means of realizing their expansionist designs and their desire for the domination of peoples and States The case of Korea is but one more cruel example added to the painful series with which we are all familiar  Those guilty of that unjustifiable aggression have been unmistakably identified by the appropriate organs of the United Nations and by international public opinion  The case has been irrevocably judged Ever unwavering in its pursuit of justice and peace, the General Assembly, in its resolution [(VII)] of August  fully in accordance with the Armistice Agreement, made specific recommendations concerning the convening of the political conference on Korea  Never have the determination to restore violated rights and the noblest feelings of humanity and practical wisdom been so intimately and constantly associated as in the work of the United Nations Now that aggression has been repelled as a result of the United Nations memorable initiative and of the military action undertaken and victoriously carried out under its auspices, the United Nations sole object in this sad affair is the unification and rehabilitation of Korea; that country must be assured a free, democratic and prosperous existence through the restoration of a true and lasting peace The delegation of the Dominican Republic has expressed its most fervent hope, and expresses it again today, that these aims, which are as noble as they are urgent, may be speedily and fully attained for the good of the Korean people and the strengthening of justice and law in the world Notwithstanding the eminent wisdom and extreme urgency of the decisions taken at the seventh session of the General Assembly, we are already witnessing delaying manoeuvres and unexpected complications plotted behind the scenes, in accordance with familiar communist tactics  That was, beyond doubt, the purpose of the cablegram sent to the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations on September by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China [A/ calling upon the General Assembly to undo the results of its long and arduous work at the end of its seventh session and to change the composition of the political conference in accordance with the desires expressed by that Government When the delegation of the Dominican Republic, whilst explicitly and rightly paying tribute to the distinguished position in international life of India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Burma, voted categorically against that attempt, it acted in complete accordance with the view it had previously expressed, namely, that General Assembly resolution (VII) of August was completely consistent with the letter and the spirit of the Armistice Agreement, and that the participation of the Soviet Union in the political conference, in accordance with the wish of the communist side, was amply justified by the position taken by that country’s government in connexion with the initiation and development of hostilities in Korea That was not the sole object, however, of the astonishing cablegram from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of communist China, since it also proposal, contrary to decisions taken by the Assembly at its seventh session [h meeting], that an invitation should be extended to the governments of his country and North Korea to send representatives to the present session to institute joint negotiations  That demand was tantamount to claiming rewards and honours for aggression and the establishment of identical treatment for the victim and the perpetrators of aggression  Happily, the General Assembly has already answered those demands with dignity and in appropriate language Again in Asia, far from Korea but in countries bordering on communist China, the governments which planned and put into effect the invasion of the Republic of Korea have for many years carried on war, with all its attendant horrors  In IndoChina, France year after year sees thousands of its noblest sons falling side by side with the gallant soldiers of the Associated States, on which it has bestowed the precious gifts of its civilization and to which it now promises the establishment of independent national governments  There, too, communism is carrying out its terrible mission of disruption and disorder; thus the vision of the Apocalypse advances on the world, bringing nearer the moment when, as the great statesman to whom my people owes its welfare and progress stated some months ago, the United Nations will have to take fully into account the heroic effort which the great French nation is still making in defence of the principles on which our civilization rests Another of the noble ends to which the free peoples of the world ardently aspire is disarmament, the achievement of which is essential to the very life of mankind  In this vital matter, in view of the practical impossibility of immediately achieving complete disarmament, the General Assembly, after full consideration and discussion at previous sessions, decided that, after appropriate control organs had been established and effectively put into operation, steps should be taken towards the limitation and balanced and progressive reduction of all armed forces and all armaments, without exception However, here again, unfortunately, the draft resolution [A/Rev  which the USSR delegation recently submitted to the General Assembly demands that we should undo the progress so laboriously achieved, which ensured a prudent and effective, if not ideal, solution to this grave question  In this draft resolution, the USSR delegation merely repeats, at any rate in general outline, proposals it has previously submitted and which could not be accepted because their sole object, like the present proposal, was to maintain the advantage of the Soviet Union in conventional forces and armaments, while eliminating the lead which other Powers had gained over the Soviet Union in weapons of mass destruction The array of grave problems menacing the very existence of mankind increases daily in complexity, bringing the nations steadily closer to a dreadful abyss from whose depths there is no return  It is essential that no time should be lost in the search for acceptable solutions based on wisdom and good faith  In the face of this supreme obligation, mere words and delaying tactics would be a sinister and unimaginable farce that could but lead to suffering and suicide For that reason we fervently hope that the courageous, frank and clear statement made before this Assembly, on September [h meeting] by the Secretary of State of the United States produce in the minds of the advocates of violence and aggression the good results that ought to proceed from the wisdom, firmness and conciliatory tone of that great statesman’s speech The work for the attainment of the purposes and principles of the Charter already accomplished by the United Nations justifies this expression of our fervent hope for cooperation and mutual understanding  The results achieved by the United Nations are in fact worthy of the highest praise; they have been attained, as any fair review of its work must acknowledge, despite extremely serious compromises which had to be agreed to at San Francisco, when the Charter was being drawn up, in order to meet urgent political necessities Mankind has an immense, permanent debt of gratitude towards the United Nations, and it is the duty of the nations devoted to peace and justice to do their utmost to eliminate from the Charter provisions which have the effect of paralysing action by the United Nations and thus gravely imperil the Organization’s strength, vigour and survival The greatest of these dangers to the survival and proper development of the United Nations is presented by Article  paragraph  of the Charter, a completely undemocratic provision which is contrary to the principle of the equality of States before the law, and which the great majority of delegations accepted at San Francisco only on the understanding that reasonable use would be made of the veto and that the veto would not be a permanent institution In view of the intolerable abuse of the veto by the Soviet Union, and in view of the fact that we are approaching the date agreed upon in for a review of the Charter, the Dominican Republic is in fullest sympathy with the proposals submitted by Argentina [A/and Add  and the Netherlands [A/ and will welcome any other proposal that may be put forward with a view to the revision of the Charter under Article  For my country, it has always been, and will always be, a point of honour faithfully to fulfil the obligations it assumed under the Charter; we cannot do otherwise than wholeheartedly associate ourselves with any effort to eliminate from the Charter the germs of paralysis and death My Government is deeply concerned about the grave problem of prisoners of war captured during the late world war, and especially the position of Spanish prisoners detained in Soviet territory notwithstanding the cessation of hostilities  Because of the Dominican people’s particularly close ties with Spain, our high humanitarian ideals and our respect for the essential concepts of justice, the Dominican Republic will raise this important matter at this session in due course It is also a matter of the greatest concern to the Government of the Dominican Republic that Spain and Italy should be admitted to membership in 'the United Nations  Spain, the glorious mother of so many American nations, whose fruitful heroism has filled the pages of history, and Italy, the cradle of Christian civilization and Western culture, are both peaceloving countries and play an important part in international life; they therefore have every right to be included, if they so desire, among the States Members of the United Nations It would be unfitting to conclude this statement without saying once again that the Government of the Dominican Republic has cooperated, and will continue to cooperate enthusiastically and fully, in the various aspects of the allembracing work of the United Nations and its specialized agencies The Dominican Republic, which was the first to raise its voice, at the Evian Conference in  on behalf of the Jewish people, who at that time were being subjected to the vilest persecutions in Hitlerite Germany, and which granted brotherly asylum to many persecuted refugees, was a member of the International Refugee Organization until that body was disbanded, and continues to interest itself deeply, and to the fullest possible extent, in the grave problems with which that body was concerned The Dominican Republic’s work as a member of the Trusteeship Council and, within the framework of that body, on the Committee on Italian Somaliland in  over which it had the honour to preside, has at all times been marked by a sincere spirit of cooperation and an ardent desire to render the most useful services it can to the international community in these highly important fields In the same way, my country maintains the closest relations with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, am admirable and useful institution with whose valuable assistance extremely interesting seminars on the promotion of literacy were held this year at Ciudad Trujillo Continuing without break the intense progress initiated in with the abandonment of sterile political methods of unhappy memory, the Dominican Republic has justly won a place for itself in the vanguard of the Latin American countries in the movement for economic and social advancement  In all the aspects of social life, which are so important to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, my country has reason to be deeply gratified at the level already achieved and the steady progress that is being maintained  We convey our warmest congratulations to the renowned Libyan diplomat Mr  Ali Treki on his recent election to preside over the General Assembly at this sixtyfourth session, as well as for his call for a dialogue among civilizations, for interreligious understanding, for the promotion for peace and security and for closing the divide between rich and poor   Exactly one year ago, when we were taking stock of progress made towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals at the midterm point, something unexpected occurred: the collapse of some of the most emblematic investment banks, and with that the worsening of the global financial crisis    Before this crisis occurred, however, the world, in particular the developing countries, was already affected by the impact of two other crises that had begun simultaneously: the crisis involving oil prices and that involving food prices   As a result of the first of these crises, that is, the oil crisis, vigorous and intense social protest broke out in various parts of the world  Suddenly, all products became more expensive  Governments were forced to use their currency reserves to pay their oil bills and were forced to allocate subsidies for the sake of maintaining civic peace and democratic governance    When it comes to the second crisis, the food crisis, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations established that as a result of the food crisis, the number of people suffering from hunger worldwide rose by million, which meant that for the first time in human history the total figure exceeded the number of billion human beings    Before these two crises broke out, the World Bank had already indicated that in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals in the remaining seven years — that is, between and — $billion were still needed, or $billion every year  Obviously, with the outbreak of these crises, which gravely affected the economies of developing countries, the resources needed to meet the objectives that had been set to cut by half the level of poverty worldwide would have to be increased significantly above the projected figures established by the World Bank   As one can see, the situation last year was already bleak at the time of submitting for analysis and evaluation the achievements that had been made and future challenges to meet in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  In spite of the dark clouds that were gathering on the global economic horizon, we still felt optimistic; we held the illusion that we might meet our targets  After all, we had made continuous progress towards meeting some of the Goals  But from then on, we witnessed the deluge of the global financial crisis  Since then, the storm has been so intense that it has created a widespread state of anxiety and fear at a global scale the likes of which has not been seen in many decades    According to the DirectorGeneral of the World Health Organization, Dr  Margaret Chan, more children and tens of thousands of women will die every year as a direct consequence of the global financial crisis  Today, while the meetings of the General Assembly of the most important global organization are being held, children will die in various parts of the world  That is the equivalent of saying that a child will die every three seconds, or children every minute    By the time I conclude my statement this afternoon — my minute statement — worldwide children will have died, whose early deaths could have been avoided  Throughout the course of this year, million children, which is equivalent to the entire population of my country, the Dominican Republic, will have lost their lives for no reason or justification  This represents a human tragedy of epic proportions, a true catastrophe  It is morally and politically unacceptable  For that reason, it is important to call upon the General Assembly to declare a state of emergency with regard to compliance with the Millennium Development Goals    When facing the challenges to our efforts to meet the eight goals established in the year for improving the human dignity and living conditions of millions of people worldwide, it is possible to adopt different attitudes  We might consider that we have failed and that these goals can never be met; that they represent a new utopia and therefore the only path    remaining is to abandon any effort to meet those goals  Clearly that would be a cowardly and irresponsible attitude — the worst possible decision  It would mean leaving all those in need of human solidarity and compassion out in the cold  A second attitude would be to reconsider the goals and then extend the timetable to fulfil them; that would seem logical and reasonable  However, that reasoning encounters one obstacle — the fact that children, the poor and the women of the world cannot wait   The only real way to ensure fulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals by the planned date, is for the General Assembly to work towards promoting true commitment among nations and governmental and nongovernmental institutions to urgently assume their task to achieve economic and social development for all people affected by poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy   It cannot be argued that the resources available to address this urgent task are insufficient  We have seen in the diligent manner used to address the collapse of the international financial system that — as the saying goes — where there is the will there is a way   Looking ahead, the first thing to be considered is that with the forecasted end of the global economic recession and the resulting gradual recovery of economic growth, we must ensure that we never again witness such a sudden and abrupt increase in oil and food prices as a result of excessive speculation and the transactions of the futures market  We issue this warning because we have been observing with concern, an increase in milk prices over the past three weeks on the international market that have risen by more than $per ton without any valid justification    We must set aside all individual interests, resistance and obstacles that stand in the way of the reform of the global financial system and the stock markets, in order to establish new mechanisms for regulation and supervision that will guarantee that no crisis such as this one will ever occur again   Because of the lack of compliance to date by the majority of developed countries with their commitments made during the Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development to contribute to the development of the poorest and most vulnerable nations and due to the prevailing situation of the global recession, we draw the attention of the General Assembly to the possibility of finding new sources of financing for the Millennium Development Goals    In that regard, we suggest the creation of a working group to carry out professional, highquality research and submit a report containing recommendations and a plan of action geared towards establishing a fine to benefit development on capital deposited in fiscal havens, offshore banks and international financial centres  Placing financial resources in such fiscal havens means that every year we witness tax evasion in a sum equivalent to $billion — a figure — according to the World Bank — equal to the total sum of external aid necessary to meet the Millennium Development Goals    According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), some $trillion is currently deposited in tax havens which do not contribute one single cent towards fiscal income  OXFAM has indicated that more than $billion in fiscal income slips through the fingers of developing countries each year as a result of offshore banks and tax havens  The organization Christian Aid has also affirmed bleakly that tax evasion is responsible for the deaths of more than million children between the year and — the years we set to meet the Millennium Development Goals   There are abundant resources in the world and what is happening is that they are unfairly and unequally distributed due, inter alia, to an existing global financial architecture marked by the lack of transparency, secrecy, moneylaundering, evasion and fraud  Our only hope of changing the current situation of economic decline and social deterioration and the moral crisis that is shaking up the world lies in adopting brave, wise and timely decisions in this prestigious global forum   The peoples of the world are waiting for these decisions  They are aware that their right to a dignified, honourable and happy life depends upon that  We cannot let them down  We must act with justice courage, a sense of history and with a vision of the future   I cannot conclude this statement without touching upon the current prevailing situation in Honduras  The United Nations passed a resolution condemning the coup d’état which took place in this Central American nation in June of this year and called for the return of democratic order  The same attitude was adopted by the     Organization of American States, the European Union, the African Union and by the League of Arab States  Despite the entire world’s condemnation of that assault on democracy, the de facto Government of Honduras has remained in power, thereby underscoring the weaknesses of the international community to take action    President José Manuel Zelaya — the sole legitimate President of Honduras, who was scheduled as the sixth speaker to take the floor in the General Assembly this afternoon — has, in a great display of personal courage and daring, preferred to return to his country  It is now to be hoped that we the representatives of the peoples gathered here at this world forum will be able to act with the same dignity, sense of responsibility and level of commitment when it comes to the supremacy of democracy, freedom and justice  \\ufeffThe Dominican Republic wasamong the countries that founded the United Nations  Butthis is only the third time, in years, that its Head ofState has come to address the General Assembly  Perhapsthe reason for this noticeable absence of our country duringthe many years that this great annual event has been heldis that following the Second World War, the internationalsystem revolved around superPower rivalry, giving rise tothe cold war  In context, it is probable that our leaders feltthat their presence here would have been merely symbolic,with no real importance That this may have been the case in the past, but theworld has changed  From the dramatic transformations inthe geopolitical environment, a multipolar internationalsystem has emerged, in which the economy matters morethan ideologies and military conflicts  This reorganizationof the international system on the basis of strategiceconomic objectives has been accompanied by a scientificand technological revolution, a revolution of knowledge thatspread across the planet and brought about the mostprofound change ever experienced in the history ofhumankind, turning the world into one large neighbourhood In the new international order that arose following thecold war, the Dominican Republic could not remainisolated  That is why we are here today: to proclaim to theworld that the Dominican Republic is now actively joiningthe group of nations represented in this multilateralOrganization, so that, through international contacts andexchange, it can contribute to forging a better future forhumanity and, accordingly, a more promising future forDominicans To ensure our participation in the various forums ofthe United Nations forums, exercising all the rights thathave been bestowed upon us, we proceeded, first, to payour financial debts in full  To the Dominican Republic,the payment of our arrears is evidence of our confidenceand faith in the capability of the United Nations to playa role in the international arena to guarantee internationalpeace and security as well as respect for human dignityand fundamental human rights Nevertheless, just as we understand that the worldhas changed, that there is a new international agendagoverned by the common concerns of all peoples overenvironment preservation, population growth, respect forhuman rights, strengthening of democratic systems,recognition of women’s rights, and the social andeconomic development of nations, we also understand thatthis Organization must be renewed and readapted to thenew world circumstances Latin America and Africa do not have permanentrepresentatives on the Security Council, and Asia has onlyone  This means that there is uneven representation in thatimportant body, which is incomprehensible in anOrganization whose Members enjoy equal footing, on theprinciple that they are all sovereign States  It is ourhumble suggestion that the Security Council should beextended to enable Asia, Africa and Latin America tohave two permanent seats on that body and that thenumber of nonpermanent representatives be increased todemocratize the decisionmaking machinery in that forumfor peace In one of his most frequentlycited works on theCaribbean, entitled El Caribe, Frontera Imperial, theformer Dominican President and author, Juan Bosch,wrote as follows:“The history of the Caribbean is the history ofthe struggle of empires against the peoples of theregion in order to rob them of their rich lands  It isalso the history of the struggle of empires againstone another to rob the possessions each one hadconquered  Lastly, it is the history of the peoples ofthe Caribbean to free themselves from their imperialmasters ”This direct contact with the major Powers over thecourse of five centuries, a product of these confrontations,5has marked the Caribbean, perhaps forever, with aparticular stamp of fragmented histories, and differentcultures and languages  Yet we are always seeking unitywithin diversity Recent years have brought greater understanding andcloser bonds between us, based on the understanding thatwe have a common destiny  As proof of this, our countryis a founding member of the Association of CaribbeanStates (ACS), an organization bringing together nations thatare very different both in ethnic terms and in developmentlevels, and thus reflecting the richness and variety of ourregion We would be pleased to see formal contact with andbacking from the United Nations for that recently createdbody, in support of the efforts we have made to strengthenour relations and to work for our peoples’ development Similarly, we have been participating in the CaribbeanForum of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States,which is made up of Caribbean countries that benefit fromthe Fourth Lomé Convention  This forum has carried out aseries of regional projects financed with European Unionresources As an observer, and aspiring fullfledged member, ofthe Caribbean Community and Common Market(CARICOM), we view with great interest the widening anddeepening relationship between the United Nations andCARICOM  We urge that the necessary steps are be takento intensify the cooperation and coordination between thetwo institutions, which would enable us to achieve ourcommon goals The countries of the Caribbean are facing thechallenges of current circumstances, as the advantages ofaccess to markets are being eroded because of theimplementation of World Trade Organization agreements,the effects of a single European market, the consolidationof the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)and the movement towards reciprocity and similar trends Our participation in preferential access schemesdepends on the observance of established standards withregard to workers’ rights, human rights, intellectualproperty rights, the environment and civil liberty — mattersthat go beyond economic considerations We have gained certain advantages from preferentialtrading with the United States and the European Union, asa result of greater prosperity that led to an increase inimport demand from those countries and an increase intourism in the Caribbean  By contrast, we must endure thecomplications of the new rules and harmonizationstandards that have come into force  We have not yettaken full advantage of the benefits deriving from suchconcessional agreements as the Fourth Lomé Convention,the Generalized System of Preferences, and the CaribbeanBasin initiative Our high dependence on foreign trade, the shortagein the supply of goods and services and unsuitablemarketing methods constitute elements of vulnerabilitythat affect, to a greater or lesser extent, all the countriesof the region  We must overcome these limitations anddefine areas in which we can be competitive Strengthening cooperation is one way to support theCaribbean integration process and rectify suchweaknesses When referring to the Caribbean, let us not forgetthe situation in Haiti, the country with which we share theisland of Hispaniola  We view with sympathy the processof democratization that is unfolding in that country, andwe appeal to the international community to do its utmostto assist in the huge task faced by the children of thecountry of Toussaint L’Ouverture in constructing a betterfuture for their countrymen One of the first foreignpolicy actions of ourGovernment was to encourage a cooperative and friendlyrelationship between the Dominican Republic and Haiti,and we put in place the Joint Bilateral Commission  Aftera fruitful meeting, which took place a few day ago inPortauPrince, that Commission agreed to a series oftechnical exchange agreements in the fields of tourism,agriculture, trade and investment, sports and border andimmigration matters  Furthermore, we defined theconditions for joint strategies to take advantage of fundsprovided by multinational sources, such as those grantedby the European Union under the terms of the FourthLomé Convention I would now like to direct the attention of theGeneral Assembly to a subject that just a few years agowas on the front pages of all the newspapers of the worldand that, even though it still has a considerable impact onthe effectiveness of development policies, has vanishedfrom the world’s attention: the problem of foreign debt The countries of the region have carried out a series ofadjustment programmes in an attempt to regain externalfinancial solvency  Nonetheless, there are stillconsiderable imbalances as a result of the burden of debt6servicing, without a corresponding recovery in the terms ofexchange that would allow us to create greater resourcesthrough our exports In the case of the Dominican Republic, foreign debtincreased fold between and  Today, thanks toour extraordinary efforts, our country is now current withits international creditors, which means that we are eligiblefor further external financing  However, being current withour payments to international credit organizations has meantthat our Government has incurred greater social debts to theDominican people  There are fewer resources to invest ineducation, health, housing and social security and,ultimately, to deal with the critical situation of poverty thataffects most of our people In its years of existence, the United Nations hasmade extraordinary efforts to eradicate bellicose conflicts indifferent parts of the world and to contribute to themaintenance of peace and international security  But greathuman sacrifice is inherent in the theatre of war, and ourimpoverished neighbourhoods have adopted the names ofwartorn places, symbolizing the extent of their fightagainst misery  In the Dominican Republic the poor andmarginalized neighbourhoods have adopted such names asViet Nam, Katanga and Cambodia; none of them, of course,is called Sweden, Japan or Germany  This means that thisinternational Organization’s new role is to guaranteeinternational peace and security through mechanisms topromote the economic and social development of the lessfortunate nations For this reason, with respect to debt, our countrybelieves that multilateral organizations that providedevelopment assistance and the donor Governments,together with the debtors, must find more lasting solutionsto the burden of foreign debt servicing, so that we canrelease resources that can immediately be used to fightpoverty and to stop the deterioration of the environment We have made progress in that regard, and it is fair torecognize that the G the International Monetary Fund, theWorld Bank and the regional banks for developmentassistance, such as the InterAmerican Development Bank,have consistently designed and implemented importantmechanisms to alleviate the foreigndebt burden, amongwhich the socalled Brady plan and the Gprogrammesfor the reduction of bilateral debt stand out However, in the near future we will need to reviewsome of the sacred principles prevalent in the internationalfinancial community now for many years, such as thoserelated to the Paris Club cutoff date and the impossibilityof debt restructuring with multilateral organizations  Thisaffects especially the socalled least developed countries,which could receive preferential treatment in this regard The Dominican Republic therefore urges all interestedparties to move forward to enable the underdevelopedcountries to implement viable programmes against povertyand marginalization, within a financially sustainablecontext In addition to the fight against poverty, at this stageof reforming the international system it is important totake all appropriate measures to fight terrorism and illegaldrug trafficking, scourges that deeply affect the normaldevelopment of mankind  Recently, international drugcartels have tried to use Caribbean routes to carry outtheir illegal operations  The Dominican Republic has beentaking all possible measures to prevent the use of itsterritory as a medium for drug trafficking and drug use For Dominicans, drug use and trafficking are a nationalsecurity problem, which we will fight with the necessaryforce to eliminate an evil that has become the greatplague of mankind at the end of the twentieth century In expressing its willingness to play a more activerole in the international system, the Dominican Republicalso expresses its concern at the many unresolvedconflicts in different parts of the world  We advocate adefinitive and peaceful resolution of the conflict in Bosniaand Herzegovina; of the search for peace in Middle Eastbetween the Government of Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization; of cooperation and assistancewith regard to situations such as those of Somalia,Burundi and Liberia  As to the Republic of China onTaiwan, we believe that due to its location in the centreof East Asia, its security and stability bear a close relationwith the peace and prosperity of that region, and wetherefore encourage both the sides along the Taiwan Straitto resume constructive dialogue with a view to achievingmutual cooperation and understanding  We believe thatthe parallel participation of both sides in the UnitedNations would be conducive to maintaining peace We stand at the threshold of a new century and anew millennium, which will bring new challenges as wellas new opportunities for human progress, and anOrganization such as the United Nations has alwaysserved to stimulate the noblest of human aspirations  TheDominican Republic, trusting in God and in the creativecapacity of its people, aspires to be a spokesman and aninstrument for channelling the ideals of justice, peace,7democracy and prosperity, which inspire the civilizednations of the world  Mr  President, first of all I wish to convey to you my congratulations on your election in the certainty that your wisdom and your qualities as a statesman and a student of the problems which affect the international political scene are guarantees that the tasks before us will lead to effective results to the satisfaction of all peoples of the world An outstanding thinker of the Antilles and foremost sociologist propounded the thesis that the moral progress of peoples runs in the opposite sense to the course of their material progress  That sociological concept applies to the successive periods of the history of civilization In the world of today we are witnessing technological and scientific progress of such dimensions that we could almost say that it has outstripped man fantasy, which has always been governed by his tremendous imagination  Thus we have come today to the invention of destructive weapons which could wipe out the human race; and, similarly, with the arrival of man on the moon we can say that we have entered upon the stage of the domination of outer space Today, almost everyone concedes that at this juncture in civilization, material progress, spurred by science, has changed the characteristics of a natural process in man that is to say, the structure of the individual and collective mentality It would be difficult to forecast how far nations can be carried by the undeniable, realistic postulate which suggests the existence of an inverse ratio between material progress and moral progress in society today From those considerations we could reach the view, which has been repeated since ancient times, that truly man is his own worst enemy  Hence the idea of domination at the cost of destruction and war has still not disappeared The work done by the United Nations to achieve peace and eliminate the scourge of war, the events that have occurred and the actions that have been taken from the San Francisco Conference to the present day to avoid the spreading of wars beyond the areas of conflict leave no doubt about how exposed nations find themselves to ruin and the violence of a third world war, perhaps of nuclear dimensions, which would wipe out any vestiges of a society which was always in ferment but which in the depths of its being cherished a noble vocation for peace  Here again, this is a threat that we all view with trepidation, because, despite the years that have passed and the efforts that have been made, we have still not been able to avoid the international tensions which appear to be the major enemy to peace The picture that I have just sketched is, as we know, in no way encouraging, and it should not really be presented here by the delegation of a country small in territory such as ours; rather it should be presented by the great Powers, which inevitably govern the destinies of mankind  However, as we are fully aware that all States are equal, and as experience teaches us that ideas are the heritage of all mankind, we are repeating a concern which we know is shared by a large part of mankind We should add to the foregoing considerations that we are convinced that these facts alone are not the only cause of the abnormalities which exist in the international order It is possible that in the world of today there exists a specific causal divisive element which makes possible this imbalance between moral progress and material progress in the world in which we live  We are referring specifically to the crisis in law  Thus we see that the more we progress towards the development of legal standards, enshrined in treaties and conventions, the weaker and more ineffective they become in the enforcement of those norms, thus ensuring the necessary maintenance of peace and reasonable coexistence  Take, for example, the failure to observe treaties setting forth a lofty humanistic vision of man, specifically in international conflicts, as has occurred in the case of the Geneva Conventions on prisoners of war, on inherent rights, on smuggling and the illicit traffic in drugs, international delinquency aggravated by the hijacking of aircraft and many other violations of the law From these considerations we conclude that if such things are happening in the international community it would not be at all venturesome to assert that the obstacle which stands in the way of peace and the elimination of international tensions is, as we have already stated, the crisis in law We have recognized that this is not the sole cause of the anguish in which we, the peoples of the world, live, but we cannot deny that such a crisis has a great deal to do with the fact that viable solutions are not being found to the problems whose solutions are the direct responsibility of the States involved in a dispute, as well as of the United Nations, which is the repository of the most powerful machinery which we can count upon for the solution of such conflicts It is not incumbent upon us to spell out in terms of doctrine a policy of such magnitude in order to break the vicious circle in which we find ourselves confined  It is certainly up to us, however, to organize, to find a way out of the critical realities with which we are confronted today, and we could discover the way out if there were a meeting of the minds on the necessity to work out a system to restore confidence, without which no permanent peace is possible Despite the conviction that this is a difficult task and that many paths will have to be smoothed in order to reach this system of security, to which reference has been made so many times by so many voices in this hall, it is equally certain that specific sacrifices are required which will test the real desire for peace which prevails in the world today One of the methods that my delegation considers would be effective would be the one referred to in resolution (XXVI), which empowers Member States to take positions on means of enhancing the effectiveness of the Security Council in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Charter of the United Nations  We are convinced that an enhancement of these methods would be a step forward towards the possibility of reaching a point where we could work out the system of security to which we have referred But we must recognize that the desired enhancement of the methods to improve the efficiency of the Security Council would require a revitalizing of certain fundamental instruments available to the Council  Accordingly, my Government stresses the criterion that the Charter should be revised in respect of the provisions on the right of veto We are absolutely certain that it will be impossible to increase the efficiency of the Security Council just so long as we do not remove from the Charter a privilege which is at odds with the very essence of democracy  We say this because, far from being a notable step forward in the features characteristic of our era, which is typified by its revolt against old structures; this privilege is in itself an archaic institution  Perhaps it was justified when the victorious Powers were laying the foundations of this world Organization and wished by the veto to rule out alternatives for international equilibrium However, we would agree that the method should be attenuated in such a way that this exceptional right should be exercised only in circumstances in which we obviously face the alternative of a conflict that could endanger world peace The Dominican Republic, which has always been known for the support it has given to the predominance of human rights in our Organization, is firmly convinced that never before has our civilization been under a greater obligation to make freedom and dignity for man a reality  Accordingly we cannot possibly concede that States may infringe or make conditional the respect for and protection of the inherent rights of the human person  It is not difficult to understand that there can be no freedom where these rights are infringed For all of those reasons my country is opposed to acts of violence in all their forms of social upheaval; hence we reject the attacks which, like the one which took place recently in Munich, constitute acts of barbarism that are the fruit of the most savage form of terrorism, as our Chief of State, H E  Joaquin Balaguer stated  This is all the more true when by such acts innocent persons who are not involved in the motives that blindly lead people to take up arms and engage in destructive activities become the victims In a period of such tremendous progress, such as that which has been made in the field of human rights, we cannot close our eyes and remain indifferent to the recent tragic events which occurred in the emotiontorn Olympic Village  For this reason, my Government could not fail to give its support to the request for the inclusion in the agenda of item concerning measures to prevent international terrorism and other forms of violence which endanger or take innocent human lives or jeopardize fundamental freedoms, in the conviction that, in addition to energetic protests, there will emerge from this hall the necessary action to put an end to such horrendous acts Nor can we fail, on this occasion, to refer to the development process which is under way in the Dominican Republic today, in accordance with the plans that are being pressed forward by our constitutional Government with relentless vigor While it is true that one of the reasons for the state of anxiety in which mankind is living today is a result of the crisis in law, it is equally true that the most effective way to deal with this situation is to obtain balanced development for all of our peoples  Hence, the words of His Holiness Pope Paul VI, who said: Development is the new name of peace  This message has reached all peoples with great conviction and force Accordingly, at this time, my Government is deeply involved in the most thoroughgoing revolution' of our structures which was ever recorded in the history of Hispaniola, with the introduction and implementation of the Agrarian Code which sets up the machinery to hand over to the farmer the land that he cultivates and to take from overgreedy hands the principal sources of the wealth of the Republic My Government hopes that after having doubled the per capita income of our country after barely six years, we will be able in a few years to continue to develop our vast wealth of resources which heretofore has been practically unproductive, so that we can continue strengthening the soundness of our democratic institutions and uproot, once and for all, the causes that have led to such frequent upheavals as are recorded in the history of the Dominican Republic As another trend within this spirit of progress which pervades the Dominican Republic, we can point to the importance that my Government has attached to the conclusions that are summarized in the Declaration of Santo Domingo [A/ annex I, sect , a basic document of the Specialized Conference of the Caribbean Countries on Problems of the Sea, which was held in Santo Domingo from to June and which was attended by Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean region On that occasion our attention was devoted not only to the problem of the exploitation of the resources of the sea, but also towards everything that is required to preserve the species as an inseparable aspect of the fundamental question of exploitation  Thus we were also able to contribute to a subject matter which involves the human environment, a matter to which this Assembly is to devote special attention  We were trying thereby to take one more step forward in respect of the complicated problem of pollution and development For those reasons it would be most appropriate if we could succeed at this session in persuading the countries represented here to find concrete solutions while we prepare effectively to apply the principles already accepted under existing conventions on the problem of the contamination of the sea, which affects us all, aware as we are that we shall have to find adequate solutions, in view of the interrelationship between pollution and the whole process of the development of nations The importance and the dissimilarity of the items on the agenda of this twentyseventh session of the General Assembly explain the interest felt by the foremost leaders of the world in finding day by day solutions more in accordance with the reality in which we live  Hence, after objective analysis of the importance of youth today and, above all, noting the fact that more than half the world is less than years of age, the United Nations has endorsed this categorical statement: The young generation is a segment of the population whose needs are growing day by day and whose contribution to development is vital As we are all aware of the responsibility that devolves upon us within this Organization to exert our efforts to work out national development plans, there is nothing more urgent for the full discharge of this duty than to incorporate youth in the serious tasks of renewal and development  Therefore we view with great satisfaction the fact that we are going to discuss the question of youth, its education, its principles, its needs, its active participation in development and international cooperation We have seen with great hope how in this past decade youth has begun to play a decisive role in the inevitable process of transformation of our social, political and economic structures and how efficiently it is carrying out its great responsibilities We can assert that we are witnessing today a phenomenon characteristic of this century and that the time will come when the new generations will have to inherit this world Organization, at which time we are sure they will champion the most cherished hopes of past generations The coming generations recognize that the United Nations is the repository of the principles and ideals for which they are fighting so dynamically and wisely in order to advance the ideas of the new era  Therefore we will advocate a reexamination of policies concerning youth, in each country national plans, so that the organizations of the world system can redouble their efforts towards the creation of new projects that will satisfy their just desires for progress In his Encyclical Letter Populorum Progressio His Holiness Pope Paul VI summarized the overriding importance of development in the maintenance of peace and the strengthening of progress when he said:All of you who have heard the appeal of suffering peoples, all of you who are working to answer their cries, you are the apostles of a development which is good and genuine, which is not wealth that is selfcentered and sought for its own sake, but rather an economy which is put at the service of man, the bread which is daily distributed to all, as a source of brotherhood and a sign of providence Allow me to conclude my statement this afternoon by adopting for ourselves this other appeal by Pope Paul VI, contained in the same Encyclical:Government officials, it is your concern to mobilize your peoples to form a more effective world solidarity, and, above all, to make them accept the necessary taxes on their luxuries and their wasteful expenditures in order to bring about development and to save the peace  Delegates to international organizations, it depends on you to see that the dangerous and futile rivalry of powers should give place to collaboration which is friendly, peaceful and free of vested interests, in order to achieve a responsible development of mankind, in which all men will have an opportunity to find their fulfillment  It is an honour to participate once again in the work of the General Assembly as a representative of the people and the Government of the Dominican Republic  At the outset, I would like to welcome and congratulate Mr  Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session This anniversary gives us the opportunity to put in perspective what the Organization has meant for humankind  It was established years ago as the fruit of the worst horrors of war and as the first global forum created to preserve peace, coexistence and the well being of all human beings  It is true that the United Nations was born of the wounds, pain and fear left by the great conflicts of the twentieth century, but it also arose from the unstoppable force of hope and the iron will of great men and women who believed in dialogue, solidarity and the grandeur of the human race Although we still have far to go and although immense challenges remain, the Organization continues to represent the values that inspire us day\\x0cA/PV after day  Over the past months, the international community has experienced difficult challenges, but it has also witnessed encouraging events that we would do well to recall  We witnessed the reopening of embassies between the United States and Cuba, which brings us closer to the day when that sad, decadeslong conflict will finally come to rest in the history books  We are also putting the final touches on a renewed commitment to global development, which is enshrined in the postdevelopment agenda in the form of the Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution   At the same time, the industrialized nations have finally taken a decisive and resolute step forward to combat climate change  We welcome their political will, for which we have been calling for some time, because we believe it represents an act of responsibility and justice that heralds a more equitable model for the distribution of responsibilities between rich and poor nations The postdevelopment Agenda provides an excellent opportunity for us to focus on our most central priority and the greatest enemy of sustainable development, namely, inequality  The fight against inequality is the point of departure for solving the majority of the global challenges, yet it remains our main unfinished task throughout the world, especially in Latin America  If we review our achievements, we see a landscape filled with light and shadow, one that offers grounds for rejoicing but also one that prompts urgent calls to action  On the one hand, Latin America, after Asia, is the region with the largest middle class, with more than million people projected to attain that status by  according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development However, along with subSaharan Africa, it is also the most unequal region in the world  Even today, the wealthiest per cent of Latin Americans receive per cent of the region’s income, while the poorest per cent receive only per cent  So, despite our efforts to combat poverty, it remains excessive and is aggravated by great inequality  As the excellent study by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), entitled “Instability and inequality”, points out, greater equality with growth requires two profound changes — first, in our structure of production, and secondly, in our structure of distribution  In other words, growth is as necessary for equality as equality is for growth  To put it even more clearly, we need both a responsible productive sector thatguarantees wealth creation across all layers of society and an active, effective State to ensure the redistribution of wealth and the creation of opportunities However, if we look at the current structure of the productive mechanisms of the countries of Latin America, we have to acknowledge the differences within that structure  In other words, we need to recognize that at least three levels of development exist simultaneously in each country  On our journey towards progress, we not only ride in different cars and in different classes, but on different rails, which means that we move forward at radically different speeds  According to a recent study of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that was conducted by ECLAC and the German Agency for International Cooperation, our region operates a highspeed rail system, as it were, which connects modern global businesses to international trade and accounts for per cent of gross domestic product but only per cent of jobs; a mediumspeed rail, which prevails in the middle income countries, accounting for per cent of gross domestic product and per cent of jobs; and finally, a rail that serves microbusinesses and the informal economy, which together bring in only per cent of wealth but account for per cent of jobs  That makes it impossible for everyone to benefit and participate proportionally in growth As the ECLAC study makes clear, what we have is a structural factory for inequality, which means that major changes will be needed to correct our path and enable everyone to advance at the same rate  We need to change the structure of production, shatter the old ways and move ahead together to a model that will benefit everyone, big and small  To begin with, it is essential that the “middle way” be promoted in particular  Public policies must help to ensure that small and medium sized enterprises have better access to credit and are more competitive, productive and innovative  Small and mediumsized enterprises must also become actors in globalization, finding their proper place in the production chains  In that way they will be able to provide not just more jobs, but proper jobs, highquality jobs, and they will be able to hire an increasingly well trained labour force Along with the necessary changes in the structure of our economies, the State should be the second pillar of the fight against inequality  We have to reassert the role of the State as an effective redistributor of wealth, as a creator of opportunities and as a defender of the rights of all citizens \\x0cA/PV Let us remember the counterexample of what happened in the , during the socalled lost decade  Poverty increased to cover almost half of the Latin American population  The austerity policy that many States opted for further aggravated the situation and slowed the recovery  In the next decade, the , the recovery began, and there was major progress in key areas, such as education  That yielded fruit in  when a labour force that was better educated than their parents was finally able to finally benefit from an expanding economy and higher wages Since then, the Gini index on income inequality has dropped by per cent  That shows clearly that social policies are essential, along with changes in productivity and improvements in the labour market  We cannot continue looking at the relationship between economic policies and social policies as an unresolvable conflict  Rather, we have to tackle both aspects at the same time and move in the same direction to reduce inequality  Only in that way can we deal with problems that seem to be endemic, but that actually derive in large measure from the disproportionate allocation of available resources Look at what has been happening to our youth  Today, this generation of young people has received more years of schooling than anybody else in our history  And yet, they have higher rates of unemployment and only parttime work  Another paradox is that, although they have more years of schooling, only one third of poor students, according to tests, meet the minimum reading competency levels  In parallel, the increasing automation of work means that soon, instead of choosing between skilled and unskilled jobs, it will be a question of skilled jobs or simply unemployment  Therefore, if we do not want that scenario to continue perpetuating exclusion, we have no other option than to make a firm commitment to quality education  And we have to do that in a serious way  The Dominican Republic is trying to improve the quality of its educational system, and we are also trying to achieve the necessary changes to make our economy grow in equality, so that our State can be active in supporting its people Inequality is the root cause of many of the challenges that we face globally, including violence and insecurity, which particularly afflict Latin America and the Caribbean  Ours is the only region where the homicide rate has increased over the past years  There is a lot of discussion about the relationship between violence and inequality  Recent studies show that a per centincrease in the Gini index leads to a similar rise in the homicide rate  And though it may sound harsh to describe that terrible tragedy in economic terms, we cannot fail to note that the impact of violence on people and goods costs us per cent of the gross domestic product in the Latin American region  At the same time, inequality is also a breeding ground for transnational crime and drug trafficking, which are recruiting young people at an increasingly early age and robbing them of future opportunities Therefore, one of the tasks facing us at the international level is to rethink our policies on how to combat drugs  As members of the Assembly know, next year the special session on the world drug problem will take place, at the request of Mexico, Guatemala and Colombia  We hope that, by the time that session is held, the idea that drugs constitute a problem that affects only some countries will have been dismissed for good  The tens of thousands of people killed in the socalled war on drug trafficking in Latin America and the Caribbean cannot be regarded as collateral damage  It is a humanitarian disaster that is due too often to policies that have been badly designed and/or are poorly implemented  We need to change our focus and reach a new, more updated and realistic international consensus that leaves room for national Governments to design policies suited to their circumstances, as some countries represented here are already doing In conclusion, may I return to the more optimistic note on which I began  The international community, represented here in the General Assembly, has made historic progress  Although we know that much remains to be done, the balance of what has been achieved in terms of the Millennium Development Goals shows that we can move ahead when we focus our efforts properly  Our experience in the Dominican Republic shows that having a clear agenda and a common course is the only way to move forward rapidly  We have therefore prepared our postdevelopment agenda, which leads us to propose a major partnership between the private sector, civil society and Government so that the change can be lasting and sustainable  We believe that when the political will exists, no challenge is too great  I have no doubt that we can find the will to overcome the challenges before us The postagenda provides the opportunity to focus our efforts on the roots of the problems  The time is now  The responsibility is ours  From now on, let us work to create countries with equal opportunities\\x0cA/PV for and access to development for all our citizens  We are working for equality and solidarity and for a fair distribution of the resources of this planet that we share  \\ufeffMr  President, permit me, in these first words, after congratulating you on the assumption of your important office, to express the confidence that we have in your wisdom and exceptional experience in the matters which affect the States which constitute the United Nations  Also permit us to extend, on behalf of the Government of the Dominican Republic, our congratulations and thanks to the General Committee of our Assembly over which you preside for the spontaneous initiative, which does it credit, of including item in the agenda of this thirtyfourth session of the General Assembly  This item relates to measures for providing assistance to my country and to the Commonwealth of Dominica, a small country which, like our own, was cruelly battered by the fury of the hurricanes of this season of cyclones in the Caribbean We must admit that this, too, represents a contribution to the peace for which the United Nations is fighting so heroically, a contribution which takes into account in circumstances like these, not only the scourge of war, but also the destructive force of nature  This tragedy, which afflicts the peoples suffering from the results of the hurricanes, inevitably gives rise not only to hunger and destruction, but also to all the upsetting results produced when economies are disrupted and when human suffering reaches such depths that it bears comparison with what happens when war, an apocalyptic figure bent upon uprooting the constitutional instrument of the United Nations, is unleashed Our country was the victim in less than five days of two cruel hurricanes which spread tragedy, horror and chaos among its inhabitants, who were hoping for a future of peace and labour in a climate of democracy, and when the Dominican Government had already set up action programmes for the economic development of the nation and had been mobilizing all the forces of production, in many scientifically new and revolutionary areas, in order to make the best use of all the resources at our disposal These adversities have suddenly interrupted and damaged everything we had managed to achieve during the past year A report by ECLA circulated to the representatives of the States Members of this Organization, reflects the extent of the damage caused in our country by the fury of these hurricanes  For the benefit of all the delegates here present, we should like to draw attention to the assessment contained in that document, which is available to all and which illustrates with reliable accuracy the disastrous situation from which the Dominican people is now suffering Like Dominica, we are now confronting the unavoidable challenge of having to repair the tremendous damage which we have sustained and which has set back the process of development in which we were so earnestly and zealously engaged, while we continue to perform the difficult task of providing aid to the thousands of victims and survivors who are now in shelters and who are urgently calling for transfer to adequate, permanent housing  Many of them still urgently need medical treatment in order to survive the catastrophe, which has given rise to hunger, poverty and other cruel sufferings In the calamitous situation through which the Dominican Republic is now passing, because of the devastation and damage caused by the hurricanes which passed through Dominican territory in the months of August and September, causing so much damage to the inhabitants of the country and to private property, we must recognize that this world Organization, its specialized agencies and the regional system, as well as many countries in the region of the Americas and other parts of the world have come to the assistance of our country  That permits us to say that we are not alone in the formidable ordeal which the Dominican nation is experiencing  We should also like to mention, in particular, UNDP, the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator [UNDRO], the World Food Programme and others which took such prompt and efficient action during the very first moments of the emergency This experience, arising from the destructive force of nature, prompts us to recall that the United Nations has not only done what it is authorized to do in accordance with the constitutional principles by which it is governed, but has even gone beyond its sphere of competence on many occasions, in order to mitigate the effects of critical situations through humanitarian programmes, including assistance in the crises which from time to time afflict the territories of the States concerned Nevertheless, these events have given the Government of my country an idea which could bring a certain tranquillity and confidence to the islands such as our own, which are at a natural disadvantage, being right in the path of tropical hurricanes and being their first victims  This devastating danger threatens the economic structure of those countries, inevitably, each year, during the period of dangerous weather The plight of the Antilles archipelago has led us, as we come to this thirtyfourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, to inform the SecretaryGeneral of the proposal of the President of the Dominican Republic, Don Antonio Guzman, whereby, its characteristic spirit of affording protection and assistance to peoples, particularly to its Member States, in its programme for peace, the world Organization should decide to create a permanent specific fund, which would make it possible to render assistance to the islands in the Caribbean in the tragic circumstances which unfortunately seem to recur every year without fail The Dominican Republic spirit of international cooperation—which prides itself on having been one of the founding Members of this Organization and of the American regional system—was highlighted recently in the peacemaking efforts which it undertook, together with the Republic of Guatemala and the United States of America, in order to find a solution to the conflict in the Republic of Nicaragua, which was on the point of spreading to other countries  This mission of mediation, carried out on a basis of equality and mutual respect which are essential elements of the law of nonintervention that is constitutionally guaranteed by this Organization as well as by the interAmerican legal system, exhausted our utmost efforts in that very difficult task which was throughout inflamed by the emotions aroused by a policy with heavily dynastic overtones The negotiations to find a constitutional formula which could put an end to the fratricidal war were blocked and, finally, peace had to be imposed by force of arms  Nevertheless, the Dominican Republic does feel satisfaction at having taken the part of a mediator in that conflict in the search for a less distressing solution for the sister Republic of Nicaragua Moreover, we must recognize that the establishment of Nicaragua Junta of National Reconstruction has rescued democracy in that territory and we trust that it will be maintained in a lasting fashion  The problem of Nicaragua is one of freedom, the cause for which countries fight that have adjured slavery and condemned it as an anachronistic phenomenon which has no place in presentday civilization In the same spirit of international cooperation, the Dominican Government supports the world energy plan proposed by Mexico for all the countries of the world, without discrimination, whether or not they produce oil  The objective of that plan would be to provide for a progressive transition, in an orderly and just fashion, from the present historical process towards a new one which would provide many more realistic prospects for the progress of mankind By speaking of these things, the Dominican Government is performing the duty it has to pursue effective international cooperation, in the conviction that, despite the inherent competence of the Organization of American States [CMS], there is a constitutional link between our two organizations, the justification for which is the preservation of peace and the prevention of war as a method of solving disputes and conflicts among States The world Organization, whose creation as a consequence of the Second World War is one of the greatest historic events of the century, has not been able to escape criticism, some of it malicious, which branded it as incapable, in spite of the means it possesses, of preventing armed conflicts which have broken out and continue to break out in various parts of the world  Those who make that judgement tend to overlook how difficult it is to maintain peace in a world which has not yet been able to free itself from the material and moral wounds inflicted on man and his ancient race by the two world wars Nations reflect man imperfection, and therein lies the root of the evil which will last until the last judgement, but which we might perhaps avoid if, instead of accumulating nuclear weapons, multiple warhead weapons and guided missies, man is able to redeem himself in the centuries to come from the negative repercussions of his origins  We may rest secure, however, in the fact that our Organization will be able to fulfil thoroughly, within a framework of indisputable realism, all the requirements for it to achieve its fundamental objectives The not entirely satisfactory events which have occurred since the signing of the Charter years ago have been events which could be described as isolated, directly ascribable to the imperfection of men and nations  We must admit, however, that these accidental and sporadic aberrations have been caused, in large measure, by the very States which founded the Organization  These States are responsible for the controversies and disputes, misunderstandings, lack of international cooperation and, above all, the lack of trust which prevails throughout the greater part of the world If this state of affairs is acceptable, what is no less acceptable is the fact that it is important to draw up an inventory of these imperfections of the historic process of the world Organization which will demonstrate to us that one of the reasons for its existence is to prevent war and preserve peace  And this is something which has obviously been done, although international tensions, the cold war and geopolitics have succeeded in causing certain erosions in the advantages of peaceful coexistence for the benefit of all peoples who are fighting in the spirit of conviction—or convention—for the predominance of peace, and although in certain periods detente has succeeded in bringing about an easing of the anxiety generated by the arms race Over the past year we have felt that the degree of progress achieved has yielded great relief for situations still awaiting solution which have been dragging on for several years  Many cases of this kind could be cited as examples where in actual fact isolated, armed conflicts have not been able to degenerate into a war of aggression which has extended to such a vast scale as did the First and Second World Wars I think we would not be mistaken if we were to say, with a feeling of justice, how much more precarious the peace enjoyed by the world would have been if our Organization had not existed  It does have defects, some of them congenital, such as the right of veto, which was essential to the very foundation of the Organization, so much so that it was said at San Francisco that if there had been no right of veto, there would have been no Charter In recent years we must feel glad at the fact that several conflicts have not broadened into true war situations and that a careful, evolutionary diplomacy has succeeded in freezing these critical situations  Just to mention two examples, let us recall the case of the Middle East and that of Central America, which is so recent in our memories Nor can we refrain from alluding also to the spirit of Camp David as well as the great and active sense of diplomatic patience displayed by the United Kingdom in its peacemaking efforts in the anomalous situations in Africa now on their way towards solutions conducive to political equilibrium at the African summit On the other hand, in considering the progress made in finalizing the implementation of the Treaty of Peace between Egypt and Israel signed on March  we cannot disregard the aspirations of the Palestinians or fail to respect the solidarity of the Arab nations, which have made such great contributions to the history of civilization  Efforts must continue to be made, however, to find appropriate and honourable formulas for the restoration of peace within secure and permanent frontiers in this area of controversy A fact of the utmost importance which will go down as a new chapter in the history of the Americas has just been written in Panama City when, pursuant to the agreement between the United States of America and Panama to finalize the status of that interoceanic canal which separates the two Americas, one of the fundamental parts of the agreement has been complied with, leading in time to the total exercise of Panamanian sovereignty over this maritime route This solution is indeed an example of how much can be achieved within the framework of justice and goodwill among States when farsighted men, united by the most lofty ideals, come to an agreement in their decisions face to face with the challenge of history In the midst of the tidal waves and storms of international politics, we must also concede that this world Organization has made progress in many areas where international tensions and the cold war have kept today disturbed world in a state of expectancy  I am referring to the growing progress that is being achieved in the various areas of human rights The wisdom and good judgement of the Commission on Human Rights, as part of the machinery of the United Nations, should not be overlooked  This assertion would be incomplete if special reference were not made to an event of the utmost importance, affecting as it does human rights in the region of the Americas and coinciding with violent explosions in certain areas where an entire freedomloving people was plunged into a bloodbath before it succeeded in winning back its freedom  This was indeed the case with Nicaragua, as has also happened in other countries where it has still not been possible to control this evil, which seems to be on the decline at times but at others seems to be causing a new crisis With these references, we must recognize that the creation of the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights, which has its seat in the nonmilitaristic capital of Costa Rica, completes the evolutionary process of human rights, which had already been initiated by the appropriate commission within the framework of the OAS  And although it is true that it has brought to human rights an institution like that of the Inter American Court of Human Rights, it is none the less true that the accelerated changes in the political outlook of the Americas require that a new injection of vigorous blood be given in order to adjust to the imperatives of our time in this part of the world We are sure that many Member States will agree that this is an imperative necessity if they do not wish to see this regional organization languish in semistatism and decadence The Court of the regional system is an innovation and an admirable experiment which should lead to beneficial experiences which will perhaps one day make it possible for there to exist in the world Organization an organ of justice of the same kind but of wider scope As far as the Dominican Republic is concerned, we are in a position to assert here that we have made important progress in this area, as a projection of the integrated programmes of the Dominican Government for the development of the country  These programmes, now more than ever, require international conditions not likely to have an adverse effect on the efforts, which the Head of the Dominican State proposes to redouble, with vigour and energy, in all the country area of activity Furthermore, the Dominican Republic wishes to reaffirm its support for the fundamental principles of international economic relations as expressed in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  Here, as is the case with all the Latin American countries and particularly those which produce commodities and raw materials, we would ex ort the developing countries to conduct their economic relations in such a way as to take into account the interests of other countries, particularly in order to avoid any action detrimental to the interests of the developing countries There exists an initiative which without doubt could be taken through dialogue within a framework of equality and mutual respect and adapted to the delicate conditions of the particular case, one that could serve to attenuate the risk to international security engendered by flashpoints of crisis  I refer to the establishment of a new international economic order in such a way as to provide the present era of civilization with what it clamours for There is also a welltested and extremely effective method for contributing to the solution of the problem of security  It is enshrined in the Charter of this Organization, and its application has produced positive results  This is the principle relating to the self determination of peoples  This is precisely the essence of the item relating to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples Over the years events have shown that the policy that has satisfied such aspirations of countries which have come to the end of an evolutionary process has proved to be correct and has justified their aspirations to become free and independent  The Dominican Republic, like all free countries of the Americas, has had to go through that process  Hence the situation prevailing in the region of the Americas today  In the circumstances, the Dominican people have lived and suffered through this experience and, whatever the vicissitudes to which we have been subjected by our destiny, absolutely all the sons of our land are also sons of liberty No matter how strewn with pitfalls is the life of free peoples, this is the road of peace and concord among men and nations  In this conviction we must recognize, in line with the thinking of the martyr of Cuban independence, Jose Marti, the truth of the statement: Our wine may be bitter but it is our wine Therefore let us welcome with open arms that small island in the Caribbean, Saint Lucia, as we see it entering the United Nations as a Member  In spite of its small size its spirit is broadened by its acceptance of the obligation imposed on it to proscribe war and to maintain peace in the world, and its dedication to the principles governing us all This idea of peace should be inculcated as a mystic teaching every day among men and nations, so that perhaps in the course of time it will cease to be a Utopian idea and man can then say that he has achieved the impossible  Therefore the Dominican Republic joins in the most recent initiative of Costa Rica for the creation, within the United Nations system, of a University for Peace  Finally, permit me to invoke on this solemn occasion that provision of the Charter which calls on all States Members of the Organization—and this is the comerstone of our policy for avoiding the scourge of war and is perhaps the synthesis of all the objectives justifying the very existence of the United Nations— to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours  The Dominican Republic wishes to expressits gratitude for the gestures of solidarity expressed byfriendly countries with regard to the passage of the terriblehurricane, Georges, which struck our country yesterday Furthermore, we appeal to the generosity of theinternational community to provide cooperation with a viewto facing both the immediate emergencies of the populationaffected by this phenomenon and the process of nationalrecovery The delegation of the Dominican Republic, on behalfof the Government presided over by Mr  Leonel Fernández,wishes to extend its warmest congratulations to thePresident of the General Assembly, the Minister for ForeignAffairs of Uruguay, on his welldeserved election to presideover the fiftythird session, which is taking place at a timeof great structural changes in global society and within ourOrganization  We also wish to thank Mr  HennadiyUdovenko, who presided over the deliberations of the lastsession of the General Assembly with such skill  Ourgratitude goes also to the SecretaryGeneral, Mr  KofiAnnan, for his devotion and efforts to guide theOrganization along the path towards modernization andreform, which will strengthen us as we reach the newmillennium The changes in the realities of the world in whichwe live make it necessary to revise international policy In this respect, the United Nations, being the universalforum, must be strengthened and renewed by increasingits activities in areas such as peace and security ofnations, the protection of human rights and theenvironment and cooperation for socioeconomic andcultural development Faithful to its principles, the United Nations mustcontinue to encourage and deepen its programme ofreforms, taking into consideration not only the complexityof the current reality, but also the future development ofregulations aimed at relieving social marginalization andethnic and religious tensions, which jeopardize the priorityobjectives of peace and development for our peoples  TheDominican Republic expresses its firm support for thenegotiations and consultations on the programme ofreform  We trust that the process will culminate insubstantial changes in the various organs of the UnitedNations, enhancing their effectiveness and leading to amore democratic, transparent and representativeOrganization, thus ensuring its ability to act to achieve itspresent objectives Fortunately, the constant threat of a nuclear war hasdiminished  Today, however, we are faced with thechallenge of combating together, and on a global scale,hunger, poverty, environmental destruction and theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, andencourage equitable development and free societies  Wemust also struggle to lay the bases of economic growth There are other security problems that requiredecisive action: international terrorism, organized crimeand illicit trafficking in arms and drugs  We must createreliable instruments to put an end to these evils andachieve acceptable levels of security for our citizens sothat they can live in peace  The politics of security isinspired by the vision of a democratic world that practicessolidarity  Security must be achieved on the basis ofpolitical, economic, social and ecological cooperation  Theprinciple of sovereign equality of States and the beliefthat conflicts of interest must be resolved peacefullyrequire global cooperation because security can beachieved only with the participation of all States That task falls principally to the Security Council  TheDominican Republic believes it necessary to enlarge theCouncil by creating new seats for the regions of LatinAmerica, Asia and Africa, thus strengthening it in thefulfilment of its functions and allowing for greaterrepresentativity The Dominican Republic believes that internationalpeace and stability are prerequisites for a secure future formankind  Democracy and respect for human rights, togetherwith justice and respect for the law, are the surest ways ofpreserving peace  General acceptance of these principlescannot be imposed, but it can be actively promoted The crisis spots that afflict large segments of theworld s population continue to be of concern to manyStates  We emphasize the need to strengthen mechanismsof dialogue and negotiation in conflict areas such as theBalkans, the Middle East and the Great Lakes region inAfrica  With regard to the Republic of China on Taiwan,the Dominican Republic reiterates the positions presentedby its President, Mr  Leonel Fernández, with regard to theneed for the international community to consider theimportance of that country, due to its geographic location,for the peace, security and prosperity of that region  Wefavour constructive dialogue between both sides of theTaiwan Strait to bring about understanding and mutualcooperation  We reiterate that the parallel participation ofboth countries in the United Nations would be conducive tothe maintenance of peace The Dominican Republic is also committed to theprocess of nuclear disarmament and vigorously protests therecent nuclear tests, as these can endanger world peace  Wereaffirm the need for strict respect for international treatieson the prohibition, emplacement and testing of nuclearweapons, in the atmosphere, in the oceanic subsoil and onthe ocean floor  We urge nuclearweapon States to use andhandle those weapons responsibly as the only protection forthose of us who do not have that type of defence  Thepreservation of world peace demands that Member Statesof the United Nations establish new nuclearweaponfreezones and protect those already existing as a guarantee ofsecurity Concern for the preservation of a zone free of nuclearcontamination is shared by the nations of the Caribbean,which is used as a transportation route for toxic and nuclearwastes  For those countries among us that depend largelyon tourism based on sun and beaches, the coastal waterquality is vital to that important sector of our economies Ongoing trafficking in illicit arms represents anotherthreat to security  The arms buildup must definitively bestopped  The relevant international conventions signed bythe Dominican Republic are very important, such as theone on illicit trafficking in conventional weapons Peaceful settlement of conflicts by means ofdialogue and accord is the best method to eliminate theuse of force in political relations within and amongMember countries  For that reason, it is necessary toenhance the efforts and mechanisms recognized byinternational law in order to resolve internationalconflicts  In that context, the Dominican Republic acceptsand defends multilateralism as the appropriate way ofachieving consensus on the main problems that afflict theworld population  Poverty, drugtrafficking, terrorism,interethnic and territorial conflicts are problems that mustnot be dealt with unilaterally For that reason we support the strengthening ofestablished international systems of justice  The signingof the Statute of the International Criminal Court isurgently needed to achieve these ends  We believe thatthe instruments to protect peace must be used beforeconflicts occur  The United Nations must take preventiveaction and respond rapidly and effectively to avoid laterconsequences  In that respect, the Convention on theelimination of antipersonnel landmines, signed by manyMember States of the United Nations at Ottowa, Canada,constitutes an important step and commitment towards theconsolidation of mechanisms for world peace Firmly based on the principle of encouraging thepeaceful resolution of disputes and the search for peaceand security in our region, the Dominican Republic haspromoted the strengthening of its neighbourly relations For the first time in more than half a century, aDominican President visited the Republic of Haiti  Thatevent and the agreements reached favour the effortsundertaken by the democratic Governments of both Statesthrough dialogue and accord, which is the best way toapproach their common problems It is in this new context of our bilateral relations thatwe wish to appeal to the international community tocontinue to provide support to Haiti  The need thatbrought about the commitment of the United Nations tothe recovery of our neighbouring country still remains The Dominican Republic has met the challenges ofworld changes at the end of this century  The restorationof diplomatic relations with the fraternal country of Cubaconstituted an inevitable step that formalized our longlasting relations with Cuba Our country seeks inclusion in the integrationist trendin our geographic and geopolitical area  Thus, this year wesigned two freetrade treaties, one with the five countries ofCentral America, and the other with the members of theCaribbean Community  Both agreements are modern,advanced and comprehensive, as they deal with trade ingoods and services and with investment and are in keepingwith the principles of the World Trade Organization  Theyare conducive to economic growth, the creation of moreand better jobs and improvement in the quality of life ofour citizens Other clear signs of this regional rapprochement andparticipation are the two presidential events held in ourcountry  In November the city of Santo Domingo wasthe site of the extraordinary summit of heads of State of theCentral American countries, including Belize, as well as ofthe Dominican Republic, and more recently, in August ofthis year, of the extraordinary meeting of heads of State andGovernment of the Caribbean Forum  Both meetings led toagreements and concrete positions regarding hemisphericand global challenges that our region must confront At the same time, we have tightened our economic,political and development ties with the other nations of ourregion, through the presence of our President, Mr  LeonelFernández, at the Summit of the Americas and the IberoAmerican Summit through bilateral visits and exchanges atthe presidential level with the United States, Mexico,Venezuela and Colombia, countries with which wetraditionally share close bonds  These regular presidentialexchanges have led to consensus on basic topics on theinternational agenda and have deepened our levels ofcooperation Allow me now to speak out the values of democracyfrom a basically social approach, since people are the trueand ultimate raison d être of democracy  Human rights andfundamental freedoms will be fully respected andguaranteed only when each citizen has a reasonable lifeexpectancy with access to health systems and theopportunity for education in a healthy ecologicalenvironment As is well known, in order to achieve these objectives,large public expenditures in these areas are necessary  Twofactors make this difficult: the external debt, a heavyburden which has dragged us down since the , and thecurrent financial crisis, which affects various countries ofthe world, including some in Latin America  Both factorsdrain away resources that could have financed socialdevelopment in this part of the world  The consequencesare obvious  Unable to improve the living conditions ofour people and help them become integrated into theglobal economy, poverty grows and democracy andstability are weakened The greatest problem facing the internationalcommunity is how to deal with the enormous economicand social imbalance from which most Member Statessuffer, with the gap between the rich and the poorcountries and with the growth in global poverty  The roleof the United Nations should be strengthened informulating and coordinating policies for cooperation andin providing technical and financial assistance todeveloping countries Human resources must take priority during thecurrent transformation of the international, political andeconomic order  Women in particular must play animportant role, as they constitute a dedicated, responsibleand active workforce and give us reasons to seehumankind as being at the centre of development andprogress The Dominican Republic understands thatstrengthening the role of women in the political, socialand economic life of Member States is essential if we areto reduce poverty and social inequality and promotedemocracy and sustainable development  That is why it isessential to give priority to policies and programmes thatbroaden women s participation in these areas We vigorously support the objectives and work ofthe United Nations International Research and TrainingInstitute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) The plans to improve the contribution of women to thedevelopment of their countries, in accordance with theirown needs, set up when INSTRAW was created,continues to be of primary importance and deservescontinued support from Member States Creating a new international order is a politicalchallenge  The conditions for this new order require themultilateral system to guarantee security and governabilitywithin the framework of respect for human rights  Incelebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights, which has been a guidinglight for building a more just world, we hope that respectfor human rights will become daily practice for allpeople In conclusion, we believe that the United Nations mustreflect on and accept the changes that are necessary for ourOrganization  That is why we enthusiastically support thereform programme, which will hope will respond to theexpectations of a United Nations in tune with our time  \\ufeffAllow me first of all to express my most sincere congratulations to Mr  Illueca on his election to the presidency of the thirtyeighth session of the General Assembly, an election which has a special meaning for the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean  Our regional group is proud and honoured at his election, since his wellknown skill and experience will ensure that the work of this session will be guided to a successful conclusion This is a fitting occasion to highlight the work accomplished by the outgoing President, Mr  Imre Hollai, who so ably led the proceedings of the thirtyseventh session Since my country is a member of the great family of the Caribbean, we are pleased to welcome most cordially the new free, sovereign and independent State of Saint Christopher and Nevis to the Organization  We share with our brothers of that new nation their legitimate satisfaction at having exercised the most sacred rights of peoples: selfdetermination  Our country was gratified to be present at the celebration of the national independence of this fraternal country and to bring a message of friendship and cooperation from the Dominican Government and the people, reaffirming once again the Caribbean focus of the present policy of the Dominican Republic We come to this thirtyeighth session deeply concerned at the continued deterioration of various aspects of the international scene  The crises afflicting peace loving nations require of the Organization a joint effort to seek the means and machinery to face the problems and find appropriate solutions This great effort should be characterized by active international cooperation with the united participation of all the Members of the United Nations At this difficult time in the history of mankind international cooperation, which is an essential element for harmonious coexistence among nations, must be the force behind our actions if we are to overcome the present situation At this stage of international life, the major decisions of concern to mankind should not be the purview of a small and exclusive group of nations  Our country looks for more dynamic international cooperation reflected in all areas—mainly in the political, economic, scientific and cultural spheres—so that the major decisions reached on issues of great importance to all may be backed by a feeling of unity and solidarity, which is essential for their effective implementation The undeniable interdependence of nations, an essential characteristic of contemporary international relations, makes it necessary that international cooperation be based essentially on solidarity—a solidarity which can contribute decisively to the genuine development of peoples At the present time, when the international community is troubled by conflicts, tension and anguish, we must draw attention to Article  paragraph of the Charter, which daily assume more significance in international relations: All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered The preservation of peace is the fundamental duty of the United Nations  To prevent and eliminate threats to international peace and security by means of peaceful settlement of disputes is a commitment which binds all Members, especially the permanent members of the Security Council We fully agree with the SecretaryGeneral when, in his annual report on the work of the Organization [y/V], he points out that It is the weakening of this commitment that has, perhaps more than any other factor, led to the partial paralysis of the United Nations as the guardian of international peace and security In view of the present conflicts, tensions and distress, it is urgent and necessary that we reaffirm our readiness to heed the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes, for that principle is the very foundation of harmonious coexistence among peoples In an analysis of the problems afflicting the world, we cannot omit the grave danger posed by the headlong arms race pursued by the superPowers  We must therefore express our concern at the virtual paralysis of disarmament negotiations  Faced with the apocalyptic image of a nuclear holocaust, the international community must demand that the big Powers make greater efforts which could lead to effective agreements and to their speedy implementation The Dominican Republic considers that we must now reaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equality of rights of men and women and of nations large and small  We must fight to create conditions in which it will be possible to maintain justice and respect for obligations stemming from treaties and other sources of international law It was with wellfounded pride that the Dominican head of State, Mr  Salvador Jorge Blanco, declared, when he set forth the foreign policy of the country on the occasion of the first anniversary of his Government, We have maintained a line of conduct which respects all the principles and norms of international law A prerequisite for giving effect to legitimate aspirations for a lasting and stable peace in the world community is the search for just and viable solutions to the many international conflicts facing us Among those conflicts, that in the Middle East deserves special attention  We reiterate our conviction that the problems of that troubled region of the world have shown that the question of Palestine is one of the decisive factors in the crisis  Hence we believe that there can be no effective and lasting solution in the absence of arrangements enabling the Palestinian people to exercise its inalienable right of selfdetermination, as has been recognized by this world Organization At the thirtyseventh session my country, together with the great majority of the States Members of the Organization, supported the right of the Palestinian people to establish a State on Palestinian territory  Likewise, we reiterate our view that any peaceful solution in this troubled region must take into account Security Council resolution (, which endorses, infer the right of the State of Israel to exist We are also concerned about the situation in Lebanon  We hope that the recently announced ceasefire will be effective and will promote constructive dialogue, putting an end to that grave conflict and ensuring the territorial integrity and sovereignty of that torn nation The Dominican Republic, which has always maintained a policy of nonintervention in the internal affairs of other States and is convinced that this is the essential basis of peace, is concerned at the foreign intervention in Chad, in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea in violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations Furthermore, we support the longdesired unification of the Korean people in a sovereign State by means of an agreement consistent with the objectives of the Charter Nor can we remain silent about our frustration when we see that the just cause of the independence of the Namibian people has moved no further towards success, in spite of the appeals of the international community From the very day the present Government of the Dominican Republic took office it has constantly expressed its profound concern over the crisis affecting the Central American region  We cannot forget that since we met at the thirtyseventh session the Central American conflict has noticeably worsened through a rise in violence, border incidents and other factors which have steadily increased the threat of a widespread military conflagration that could endanger the peace of the continent The Dominican Republic has always associated itself with the responsible advocates of political understanding, of a peaceful solution resulting from constructive dialogue, and of the elimination of ageold obstacles which, rooted in underdevelopment, social injustice and a lack of democratic institutions, are the root causes of this serious conflict involving brother peoples whose legitimate demands are in every way understandable Foreign interference, the unbridled arms race and ideological approaches that would place the problem in the framework of a broad and exclusive confrontation between the superPowers, are powerful contributing factors in a decisive worsening of the situation None the less, all is not bleak for the future of the region  Faced with the concern and legitimate interest of many peoples, organizations and political forces and with the demands of an international community which is deeply concerned and determined to avoid an allout war or the slow and ruinous process of a chronic crisis like that in the Middle East, the surrounding countries have taken the significant step of forming the Contadora Group, which has earned unanimous international support, with my country among the first to praise its efforts The Contadora Group has carried out praiseworthy work  It has built a cordon sanitaire that can prevent a widespread war, the dangerous military solution, whose political and social costs would be lethal to the development of the peoples of the area and to their legitimate desires for democracy and freedom  Such a questionable solution would be essentially a temporary one and would in the short term be a startingpoint for new stages of tension and violence and would without doubt carry with it still greater risks  In the worst case, it would be the execrable peace of extermination of which the illustrious Roman historian warned in his celebrated annual Furthermore, the Contadora Group has created a framework for dialogue through which concrete proposals have been made on the basis of which a just, viable and lasting peace in Central America could be built The elements of those proposals should lead, in the regional framework, in accordance with the Cancun Declaration, to control of the arms race; the elimination of foreign advisers; the creation of demilitarized zones; the prohibition of the use of       some States for the development of political or military destabilization actions in other States; the eradication of transit of and traffic in arms; and the prohibition of other forms of aggression or interference in the internal affairs of any country in the area  [SeeThe Cancun line of thinking, the essence of which is regional political understanding based on respect for the principles of noninterference and the selfdetermination of peoples, necessarily implies a strengthening of democratic institutions, the guarantee of the observance of human rights and a programme of socioeconomic development leading to social justice Recently, in a significant forward step, the Central American nations ratified a Document of Objectives which were formulated, on the basis of the Cancun Declaration, in Panama at the beginning of September Of course, it will now be a matter of implementing those agreements, and we are neither deceiving ourselves nor being pessimistic if we say in a sense of realism that that implementation will be difficult, that it will be an arduous task, given the extreme complexity of the factors fuelling the Central American tragedy Aware of that reality, the Presidents of the Contadora countries stated the following:We appeal to all members of the international community, especially those which have expressed sympathy with the efforts of the Contadora Group, and to the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations and the Chairman of the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States, to contribute, with their experience and diplomatic capability, to the search for peaceful solutions to the problems of Central America  That appeal may be a realistic one  As has been stated, what is at issue is a complex problem with roots that are regional but magnified in many ways by interests alien to the region  The implementation of the Panama agreements—what might be described as an attempt at a Central American peace project—will require concrete, broad and significant support for the Contadora Group by the international community The Dominican Republic has always considered that Contadora should be complemented by efforts of many types to remove obstacles and facilitate the implementation of agreements and solutions Recently, the President, Mr  Salvador Jorge Blanco, in a statement made during the celebration of his first year in office, said:The Dominican Republic clear position in favour of Central American peace not only has been expressed in statements and declarations but has also been reflected in wideranging conversations and resolute action with heads of State and ministers of other nations, which have led to several official visits to our country An unshakable readiness for dialogue, good offices, mediation and contribution to all efforts likely to generate favourable conditions for peace in Central America is and always will be a constant of the foreign policy of the Dominican Republic, based not only on the duty of solidarity of all nations in the light of the principles of the international legal order but also on the fact that it is a Caribbean nation with a legitimate interest in preserving peace in a region in which, if it were caught up in a total military escalation, the security and institutionally of many nations such as our own would be endangered In my statement at the thirtyseventh session  I referred to an event in the south Atlantic which deeply touched Latin America and prompted a united reaction in support of Argentina just territorial claims It is an unassailable fact that until the situation of the Malvinas Islands is resolved in a just and peaceful way it will continue to be a source of serious concern to our region  We therefore cordially urge the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to resume negotiations to find as soon as possible a peaceful solution to the dispute concerning sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands The Dominican Republic reaffirms once again in this world forum its forceful condemnation of the policy of apartheid, which we consider to be a crime against humanity  Similarly, we condemn and reject all forms of discrimination as a violation of human dignity The Dominican Republic has expressed in the Security Council its regret and concern at the tragedy of the Korean passenger aircraft and affirmed that that unhappy occurrence that cost the lives of innocent people and deeply touched the conscience of the international community must not be repeated in any circumstances We reiterate that that tragic event must not prevent the continuation of efforts to ensure detente, disarmament and peace On the occasion of the thirtyfifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Dominican Republic cannot fail to record its strict observance of the norms and provisions of international conventions and instruments on human rights We repeat our conviction that respect for human rights constitutes a common good the protection of which is recognized in the norms of international law  We therefore affirm that respect for the fundamental rights of the human person is one of the most effective means of achieving peaceful coexistence for the member States of the international community During the last session we stated that the Dominican Republic unreservedly condemned violations of human rights in any part of the world, and we say it again today with equal conviction and force The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in its article  enshrines cultural rights, that is, the right to participate in the cultural life of the community  We consider that the benefits of education, science and art must be shared by all and that every man and woman must be in a position to exercise his or her creative faculties  In this connection, we support in particular cultural exchanges and international cooperation as effective means of strengthening the spiritual links between peoples To ensure the harmonious and just development of all human activities, it is essential to improve the status and rights of women  At the national level, the Dominican Government has created in Santo Domingo a general bureau for the advancement of women  At the global level, I am particularly pleased to refer now to the recent inauguration in Santo Domingo of the headquarters of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women, a permanent United Nations agency For that purpose, our Government donated the building in which the Institute has established its headquarters  With that contribution the Dominican Republic has expressed its resolute support for the cause of women and their full integration in the political, economic, social and cultural life and in the process of development in those various sectors   The grave economic crisis afflicting the international community continues to be a source of great concern  Few countries have recorded any economic growth recently  The stagnation of trade is evident, the prices of raw materials remain depressed and the industrialized countries, in their effort to emerge from the quagmire of recession, are maintaining protectionist measures that obstruct free international trade The worldwide recession has, without any doubt, hit the underdeveloped world the hardest, as it lacks the industrial and financial potential and the social and technological development of the industrialized countries The thirdworld countries continue to face growing external indebtedness, generated mainly by the accumulation of balanceofpayment deficits, the flight of capital, the sharp decline in the gross national product, and fiscal deficits that cannot be financed  In some of them galloping inflation and mass unemployment persist  Moreover, our countries are experiencing a gradual contraction of income because of a deterioration in the terms of trade as a result of a decline in commodity prices and continued protectionist measures by the industrialized countries, to which we have already referred The Dominican Republic, as a developing country highly dependent on its exports of commodities, has of course not been able to escape the effects of the international economic crisis We must nevertheless point out that it has been an accomplishment of our Government, through rational and sound management of resources and of the nation funds, not only to maintain and strengthen social peace and democratic institutions, but also to begin genuine economic recovery in many aspects  In this connection, in a recent issue of a major European magazine specializing in economic affairs, the Dominican Republic appears among the top countries of the developing world with a healthy economy and in fourth place in the Americas  Likewise, our country has been placed twenty seventh among all those countries in the world with regard to economies practiced to control inflation We know, however, that the major goals for full development will not be achieved without the concurrence of efforts and action by the international community to create a new and more just economic order among the peoples of the world At the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of  in preparation for the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the developing countries adopted the Buenos Aires Platform, which contains important statements with a view to reactivation of the world economy and accelerated development of the thirdworld countries, mainly in the areas of international trade, commodities, financing and other relevant issues In spite of the disappointing results of the sixth session, we consider that the statements in the Buenos Aires Platform constitute the most coherent basis for the promotion of the NorthSouth dialogue and for eventual global negotiations from which the new international economic order may result, giving full effect to the economic rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights The frustrating experience of Belgrade prompts us, furthermore, to reaffirm the need to strengthen and increase SouthSouth cooperation as one of our main responses to the crisis We are pleased to recognize that our region has begun to take significant steps with determination and energy, following the example of Simon Bolivar, the Liberator, whose bicentenary we are enthusiastically celebrating Indeed, the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean have begun a process of harmonizing measures enabling the region to face the present crisis, through the development of its capacity for action and strengthening its systems of cooperation  That process is a response to the initiative of the President of Ecuador, Mr  Osvaldo Hurtado Larrea, strongly supported by the Dominican President, Mr  Salvador Jorge Blanco, with the collaboration of the Latin American Economic System [LAES] and ECLA, whose work concluded with the socalled Santa Domingo Commitment, adopted by countries at the meeting of personal representatives of heads of State or Government of Latin America and the Caribbean, held from to August at Santo Domingo In his statement opening that meeting, the President of the Dominican Republic stated the following:In keeping with our conviction as men of the Americas, we are fully at one with the idea of establishing a Latin American strategy expressed in a concurrence of views for negotiating with the industrialized countries and at the same time for uniting the will of our Government concerning the need to implement integrationist policies, both in international trade and in areas of production, energy, transport, technological development and other basic sectors of the economy of our peoples In the Santo Domingo Commitment, urgent attention is given to the adoption of a joint plan of action concentrating primarily on the areas of promoting and strengthening regional cooperation and integration, fostering intraregional trade and supplying food, energy and services and on international financial and monetary problems The specific elements of the joint plan of action will be considered and formalized at a high political level at a Latin American economic conference to be held at Quito in January  It will be convened by the President of Ecuador, in consultation with the other Governments of Latin America and the Caribbean  Preparatory work has been entrusted to a group over which we have the honour of presiding and which also includes Peru, Argentina, Jamaica, Ecuador and Costa Rica Recently, at Caracas, the ninth regular meeting of the Latin American Council of SELA took place  Its main resolutions are aimed at strengthening the regional negotiating capacity  Of particular interest is resolution  relating to Latin American and Caribbean support for the convening of the abovementioned Latin American economic conference at Quito The developing countries require the priority attention of multilateral financial institutions in order to resolve their financing and international trading problems, as these have a negative impact on the wellbeing of their peoples, affecting their pace of development and the appropriate level of domestic economic activity, which leads to an increase in social and political tensions While we recognize the efforts made by IMF to help countries in their adjustment processes, we understand that the terms involved in the financial stabilization programmes inherent in these processes need to be more flexible and that the financing bodies need to be strengthened through provision of the resources they need to carry out their task  In this connection, we are deeply concerned at the decision of the Interim Committee of IMF to reduce the annual lending capacity of IMF to per cent of the quota  Finally, the delegation of the Dominican Republic, which I have the honour to preside over, wishes to appeal to human conscience, to all those who bear on their shoulders the heavy responsibilities of the destiny of their respective countries, so that given the serious political and economic crisis that threatens the very existence of mankind, wisdom and mutual respect may prevail instead of the violence that generates the worst of evils  This would indubitably promote a better understanding, which would open the doors to cooperation and solidarity among peoples, the supreme objectives of the United Nations  On behalf of the Dominican delegation and on my own behalf I take great pleasure in congratulating Mr  Carlos Sosa Rodriguez, the representative of Venezuela, on his election as President of the eighteenth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations The fact that Dr  Sosa Rodriguez will direct the debates and work of this session of the Assembly is in itself a guarantee of its success  The outstanding qualities of the new President have become manifest during the years in which he has served with distinction and brilliance as representative of his country in this world Organization and in other diplomatic posts His tact, moderation, sound judgement, conscientiousness and legal abilities augur well that the problems facing the United Nations will be approached and considered in the way that will most benefit mankind now and in the future The Dominican people, as a member of the family of American nations, are glad that a representative of our group will serve as President of this General Assembly and, even more so, that he is a worthy representative of the country of Bolívar  This is so because the Dominican people owe a debt of gratitude to the people of Venezuela as their most steadfast supporters in the arduous struggle to free themselves from the cruel tyranny to which they had been subject for more than thirty years The Dominican Republic stands before you today painfully shaken by the recent events that have caused the suspension of the constitutional rule which began on February of this year  The facts, true or false, have been reported in all quarters of the world, and have aroused great uncertainty We are the first to regret what has occurred, but in the face of the accomplished fact and completely alien to it, we have acceded to the appeal of the people, and, without any political commitments other than those imposed by the need to help the country and the desire to restore as quickly as possible the constitutionality that has been suspended, we have assumed the duties of the Foreign Office in order to strengthen international relations and thus contribute to the process of reconstruction which is necessary whenever the democratic progress of a nation has been interrupted We do not condone coups d'état and would never have agreed to participate in the present Government if the military authorities had arrogated to themselves the right to rule the State  Now that the military authorities have discharged what they considered to be their duty, they have established an auspicious precedent in America by handing over control of the Government quickly and of their own accord to a threeman civil executive, to which they are completely subordinate and which the overwhelming majority of the people accept and support, realizing the integrity and prudence of the men who compose it We offer our friendship to those nations with which we have traditionally maintained relations, and we wish to be received in like manner  This is essential if we are to carry forward the process of transformation inevitable in the world of today, in which manifest inequalities among men anger those who lack all material possessions and harden the hearts of the privileged who are surrounded by abundance  We will never, however, make the task which we are in duty bound to carry out in our nation dependent on our recognition or nonrecognition Our mission will be fulfilled  And, just as the traveller who must reach a certain destination does not abandon his journey for lack of a vehicle, we shall reach that destination  If we go on foot, we shall reach it more slowly; if we go by automobile, we shall reach it more quickly  But there can be no doubt that we intend to reach that goal and shall reach it however difficult the road may be The generation in the Dominican Republic to which I have the honour to belong accepts the challenge of fate, and with all the respect which we owe to the memory of our forebears, we shall break the shackles of the semifeudal, patriarchal or interventionist systems which have regrettably produced social conditions that affront the dignity of the worker and the peasant  The forum of the United Nations is an appropriate place to declare emphatically that Santo Domingo will, despite reverses, become through the efforts of its people, a showcase of democracy, founded on a revolutionary process that is genuinely our own As President Kennedy once said, lost opportunities are seldom recovered  The Dominican Republic may very well prove to be an exception to that rule  If the lessons of the tragedy which our longsuffering country has undergone are correctly learnt, the opportunity of democracy will not have been lost Democracy in the Dominican Republic did not fail because the people were inadequately prepared to assume their responsibilities  The first genuinely free elections which were held in the Dominican Republic in December after three decades of political obscurantism proved the contrary  That they were model elections has been confirmed by some forty distinguished representatives from the hemisphere who were invited to observe them at the request of the Dominican Council of State  The failure of democratic government in the Dominican Republic was the fault of its leaders  Democracy did not fail; the Dominican people showed their discipline and responsibility at the ballot box  We, their leaders, failed our people  We must all assume a share of the responsibility for the failure of the administration  The bitter truth is that democracy was very badly served in the Dominican Republic  This is one of the first lessons that must be learnt This fiasco in the past of the Dominican Republic should be regarded as a prologue to its future  The second lesson to be learnt from the experience of the Dominican Republic is that Latin American problems are primarily political and only secondarily economic  In our preoccupation with economic development, we have lost sight of its political aspect  Within the Alliance for Progress a comprehensive strategy for economic development has been set in motion  However, what we really need in Latin America is an overall strategy of political development, together with the political tactics necessary to bring it to fruition Would it not be more prudent to bring all the forces of the hemisphere to bear on the creation of stronger movements based upon democratic foundations and firmly supported by democratic traditions  Would it not be more salutary to devise methods to prevent extremists of the right or the left from destroying the political keystone of a middleoftheroad democracy  In other words, can we in Latin America achieve justice unless there first exists a political atmosphere favourable to democracy  In our exclusive preoccupation with economic development we seem to be forgetting these facts The third lesson to be learnt from the Dominican question is that the small core of progressive and reformminded Governments in Latin America is in greater danger of being overturned by preventive coups d'état than by external enemies  The participation of the armed forces in politics is not peculiar to Latin America; it is a universal phenomenon  It exists in the Middle East, in Turkey, in Pakistan and in SouthEast Asia  It is not unknown in Western Europe  Even in the United States the absolute supremacy of the civil authorities has been defied on various occasions  In the Western Hemisphere, only three countries have succeeded in overthrowing the supremacy of the military  In each case, however, this was achieved through the violent overthrow of the entire social structure  In other countries of the hemisphere, there has been a progressive growth and a maturing of the military establishments, but this does not mean that the military have everywhere abandoned their political interests  Recent events, including those in the Dominican Republic, prove the contrary  The point is that the participation of the military in politics in Latin America has taken very deep roots and has become too entrenched an institution to be eradicated at one stroke  It is well to remember that on more than one occasion in the Western Hemisphere it was the civilian authorities who persuaded the military to engage in political activity Democratic governments with a progressive outlook must be protected from the demagogues, from the coup d'état of ambitious men and from the political manoeuvrings of unscrupulous politicians who, together or separately, attempt to satisfy their ambitions by playing upon the ignorance and poverty of the people  I emphasize these three dangers because I think it is unjust to put the blame for all the evils of Latin America on the armed forces, which have often made remarkable efforts to overcome their own imperfections  This happened in the specific case of the Dominican Republic, where despite the errors that were made, the armed forces have given positive evidence that they have every intention of discharging their duty It is absurd to hope that the InterAmerican system, as a unit, can serve as a kind of hemispheric shield to protect its individual members against internal attack  Nevertheless, such a shield could and certainly should be forged through the resolution and efforts of the people themselves if democracy is to flourish on the continent We believe in nations as we believe in their statesmen  And because we believe in their statesmen, we know that in these difficult times in which many countries of our continent have fallen victim to the defects which we should like to correct, these men will in this solemn hour act not according to sterile political conventions but in accordance with a humane understanding of their people and of the individuals who compose them In the Dominican Republic, the present Government could have promised a return to constitutional normality by Offering to hold elections before the appointed time it had set for the fulfilment of its mandate, which is not to exceed two years and during which municipal, congressional and presidential election are to be held, the firstmentioned immediately after the end of the first year of government Elections such as those of last December — encompassing in one single poll municipal councillors; municipal executive representatives; representatives to Congress, that is deputies and senators; representatives to the Assembly for the revision of the Constitution; the VicePresident and President of the Republic— would produce results as surprising as the previous ones, because the Dominican people, despite the difficulties of their life, have a kind of instinct which leads them along peaceful paths in the decisive moments of their history  They gave proof of this in their fight against the armed dictatorship of Trujillo and again when they went to the polls on December  Elections would undoubtedly be a further manifestation of democracy, but, in view of the bitter experience that we have already undergone, we ask ourselves whether this manifestation of democracy would be the final proof that we had achieved democracy and that further risks had been eliminated With obsessive interest, we ask ourselves what is the meaning of democracy  And in doing so, we cannot fail to note the concluding paragraphs of the statement made by the United States Assistant Secretary of State, Mr  Edwin M  Martin, published in the New York Herald Tribune of October, in which he said: I fear there are some who will accuse me of having written an apologia for coups  I have not  They are to be fought with all the means we have available  Rather I would protest that I am urging the rejection of the thesis of the French philosophers that democracy can be legislated —established by constitutional fiat  I am insisting on the AngloSaxon notion that democracy is a living thing which must have time and soil and sunlight in which to grow  We must do all we can to create these favorable conditions, and we can do and have done much  But we cannot simply create the plant and give it to them; it must spring from seeds planted in indigenous soil  These are the seeds which we wish to plant in our own sorely beset country, for we firmly believe that democracy has its roots in the primary political cell of society, whether it be called municipality, city, corporation, town, village, borough, canton or anything else  We are thus convinced that only when man is able to govern himself freely and by his own efforts, resources and incentives in his own small locality and thus to transform it into a small paradise of which he may be proud, will he be equally able to govern that aggregate of localities, great and small, which make up the nation  We want to begin our task of planting the seed in our own soil and thereby constructing a democracy from the base up to the apex and not from the top down to the bottom We shall start by constructing the Dominican municipality so that it can govern itself and will not be dominated by the central Government along with which it is elected, and so that its destiny will not be directed by political bosses from an office in the National Palace  The continuity of the legislative power must become a firmly established practice; the legislature must he partially renewed so that the national Government will not have to rely on inexpert legislators submissive to its every demand  We wish to establish an autonomous career judiciary, so that the judges will not owe political servitude to the Chief of State and pay lipservice to him which might threaten democracy  We wish to establish a balance of powers so that democracy, which is social equilibrium, shall not be forced to maintain that equilibrium with the absolute power of a single man in one plate of the balance and the sabre of the army in the other In order to accomplish this task we shall again make use of the technical assistance which the Organization of American States offered us during the last elections  The effectiveness of that assistance was proved then, and it will be confirmed again on this occasion when we shall have the time which we did not then have The Dominican Republic, per cent of whose population are peasants, cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the spiritual and material poverty that is the lot of this majority, which has not so far received any positive benefit from the social advances that have been made in the course of the twentieth century  The Dominican peasant, like those of the majority of our sister countries of Latin America, is still subject to the rigours of a permanent outdoor life  His work is bedevilled by a system which leads to the perpetuation of his poverty through indifference towards ignorance and disease and the exploitation of his illusions by the false promises of a succession of candidates who, when they achieve power, ignore those promises or put off their fulfilment indefinitely Practical and immediate justice for the worker in the fields, on whose labour the present and future of the Dominican Republic depend, must be forthcoming during the tenure of the civilian Government which today guides the destinies of my country  It has an obligation to its people, who, on December last year, cast their vote not for a man or a political party, but for reforms in the economic and social structure of the country which would bring to the homes of the wretched masses not only freedom from hatred but also the possibility of adequate nourishment, of living under their own roof, of cultivating a piece of land of their own and of educating their children  Those promises were unfortunately postponed so as to make way for a series of political adventures which smashed into a thousand pieces the hopes of the Dominican people It is the duty of this Government —if it is to justify itself before history— to carry out in a spirit free from demagogic motivation whatever efforts may be necessary to restore the faith of the Dominican people in their ability to achieve a better life along the broad highway of representative democracy  It should be pointed out that progress towards this goal will be slower if the political and economic sanctions deriving from certain international pronouncements are kept in force  I must, however, emphatically declare that it is the firm decision of this Government to mobilize all the resources at its command in order to realize the legitimate desires of the Dominican people to free their nation from the status of an economic satellite As a first step in our resolve to set to work without delay, I make a formal request from this world rostrum to the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations for this Organization to help us immediately by providing technicians who can proceed as speedily as possible to Santo Domingo to study the legislation that may be necessary to guarantee to the peasants of my country a minimum return from their labour  I wish to put forward the idea that, just as the worker enjoys a minimum wage for his daily hours of work, so the peasant, who cannot limit his working day to a certain number of hours because of factors beyond his control, should have the assurance that when the harvest is in, his efforts will have guaranteed a minimum decent life for him and his family Latin America, which is basically agricultural, must answer without further delay the anguished cry of an immense majority of peasants whose fate can no longer be left in the hands of those who have exploited them in the past or of the dreamers of today who wish to remedy injustice with empty words and insubstantial promises I should like, before concluding, to explain the Dominican position on foreign policy, the essence of which was set out in the statement made by the Chief of Government when he took office and is as follows: Now that absolute tranquillity has been assured throughout the nation together with the full exercise of power by the Triumvirate over which I have the honour to preside, I wish to refer to the very important matter of the foreign policy which the Dominican Government will follow and which can be summed up in the unshakable decision to honour ail international commitments undertaken in the name of the Republic  Within the framework of the InterAmerican system, it will be our constant concern to strengthen our ties with the sister countries of America and to fortify the Organization of American States, that regional organization which has so consistently and effectively come to the aid of our country in moments of deepest anxiety  And thus will it be possible to convert into reality the programmes designed to give effect to the concepts of the Charter of Punta del Este, so that the Alliance for Progress may continue more rapidly to assist in improving the level of living of the Dominican people  This is the supreme goal of the Triumvirate, which is convinced of the urgent need for reconstructing the economic and social life of the country, so that the overwhelming majority of the people may be provided with the maximum opportunity for betterment  In referring to this economic and social aspect of the undertakings given at Punta del Este, we do not wish to leave unmentioned the obligations deriving from the Eighth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, which likewise took place at Punta del Este   The Triumvirate will endeavour with all the means at its disposal, to offer the Western world its fullest cooperation both in the United Nations and at every international conference in which the future of America is involved I shall conclude by recalling that although in this difficult moment of its history the Dominican Republic is cut off from diplomatic relations with the Governments of Latin America, it does not forget the fraternal ties that bind it to a race which has suffered so much precisely because it has been wanting in the mutual understanding that should exist among peoples having a common ancestry so that they might rediscover their own destiny, which cannot be forged except by ourselves Santo Domingo, steeped in history and the pride of a whole race, regrets that it is unable to greet those Governments which have not yet officially granted recognition to ours, but it enthusiastically and with deep emotion embraces all the peoples of America, who in the present and for the future constitute the refuge of Christian civilization  The voice of the Dominican Republic, which is raised, not for the first time, in support of mankind’s endeavor to defend peace based on justice, has a moral right to be heard in these precincts because of the sincerity which has inspired the actions of the Dominican people throughout their history In the darkest days of, the war, when the fate of the democracies appeared still uncertain, our country collaborated actively on behalf of the cause of right then being upheld on the battlefield by the peoples who are today sharing in the deliberations of this high assembly, now meeting in an atmosphere of uneasiness  This fact should, however, only spur it on to greater efforts for the benefit of mankind A few hours after the treacherous attack on Pearl Harbor, the Dominican Republic, honouring its tradition of law and its international engagements, resolutely went to war to show its solidarity with, and to share the fortunes of, the victim of that hateful aggression, thus taking part at its side in the hazards and responsibilities of the struggle for the defence of freedom of the peoples, and of human dignity  In conformity with this attitude, on the historic occasion of the third meeting of Foreign Ministers in Rio de Janeiro, we championed a joint declaration of war by all the American nations against the totalitarian powers  For the sake of continental solidarity, we supported the agreements there adopted, although they were in fact less radical than the position taken up and the views maintained by the people and Government of the Dominican Republic As soon as victory began to dawn on the horizon, victory won at the price of such cruel sacrifices, we devoted all our energies to securing effective collaboration in the efforts at San Francisco to produce a world organization worthy of the high destiny of mankind and of civilization Once the proposal which brought the United Nations into bang had taken final shape, we placed all our reserves of faith and hope in it  We remain loyal to the ideals which inspire it despite the occasional disquieting vicissitudes which sometimes seem to cloud the future of this institution of worldwide importance, and for that reason the future of all mankind It is a source of satisfaction to us that we can now appear in this Assembly and furnish the clearest proofs that we have fulfilled all the agreements and recommendations directly or indirectly connected with the mission and activities of the United Nations  We have, in fact, ratified the following conventions, for which we have deposited the appropriate instruments with the Secretariat: that creating the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization; that dealing with the privileges and immunities of the United Nations; that relating to the constitution of the International Refugee Organization; that relating to the Agreement on interim measures, to be taken in respect of refugees and displaced persons; that referring to the Protocol amending the Conventions on Narcotic Drugs; that concerning the World Health Organization; the Agreement on the International Monetary Fund; the Agreement on the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and that relating to the constitution of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations To the above list might be added the fulfilment by the Dominican Republic of other resolutions adopted by the Assembly, including all obligations of an economic character, but because of the extreme humanitarian importance of the subject, I wish to make special mention of the contribution which our country has just made to the International Children’s Emergency Fund  When the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration came to an end, the International Fund was formed with the noble aim of helping destitute children  The Dominican Republic, after loyally fulfilling all its obligations to UNRRA, is now giving its complete collaboration to the new body  It has not only sent a very handsome contribution, but has offered hospitality to thousands of European, children who will now be able to find homes and succour in our country under the protection of the Dominican State In such circumstances it is only natural that the Dominican Republic should take the most lively interest in the subjects on the extensive agenda of this session of the Assembly  Although this interest applies to each and all of the said subjects, we wish nevertheless to refer to one or two in particular in order to define, from the outset, the position of the Dominican Government with regard to them First of all we must consider the problem connected with the exercise of the privilege of the veto  As a country belonging to a continent where the principle of the sovereign equality of States is regarded as inviolable, the Dominican Republic could not view with sympathy the establishment of an exclusive privilege for the great Powers; nevertheless, at San Francisco we bowed to an expediency which the facts seemed to warrant  Now, however, the need to perfect legal systems and adapt them to the great ideals which animate the United Nations calls for a reasonable revision of that privilege in order to try to make it better adapted to the fundamental principles underlying the Charter, and particularly to that of the juridical equality of States  We entertain the hope that at no distant date this privilege will, disappear entirely; but we feel that, in view of the far from satisfactory results of the use which has been made of it, we must all, here and now, endeavour to secure some regulation of it which will reduce its present disadvantages and adequately restrict its use With regard to Palestine, our position was clearly defined at the special session of the Assembly which was convened especially for that purpose  After reading the carefully prepared report of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine we are confident that a harmonious and just solution can be reached for the two great peoples, Arab and Hebrew, whose destinies are linked to that territory  We admire and respect those two noble peoples, whose rights and aspirations are supported by thousands of years of tradition, and, in accordance with our policy of sheltering and protecting all unjustly persecuted groups, we have offered the Jews work and a home of their own in our country Turning to the Treaty of Peace with Italy, we have associated ourselves with the proposal of the Argentine Republic that the agenda of this session of the Assembly should include discussion of a recommendation that the interested Powers be invited to consider revision of that instrument  We were moved to do so out of admiration for the Italian people’s achievements in the history of human culture, because of the ties of friendship which link that great country and all the Latin nations, and because of the sincerity it has shown in its desire to be associated in the democratic life of today We come, finally, to the special situation in Greece  It is evident that the Greek people is in the throes of a civil war which, it is alleged, is sustained by the interested assistance the insurgent bands are receiving from neighbouring countries  That being so, intervention by the United Nations in this affair is fully justified by the necessity of clarifying the position and lending Greece such assistance as circumstances may require for the purpose of freeing it from those foreign elements which are trying to create a state of anarchy there in violation of the respect due to the sovereignty of nations  And if it be asserted that precise evidence is still lacking, we nevertheless feel that it is entirely justifiable for the United Nations to carry out a full investigation of such a conflict with a view to adopting appropriate measures in accordance with international practice and with the provisions of the Charter which are the foundations of this Organization All civil wars which have possible international repercussions not only disturb the internal peace of the country concerned, but endanger the peace of neighbouring areas and consequently jeopardize that of the whole world  We trust that the United Nations, by the efficacious use of its resources, will be able to clarify the present dispute in Greece and ensure the respect due to the sovereignty of each nation, so that all may live together peaceably in every quarter of the globe There is no doubt about the weight of the responsibility and the immensity of the burden imposed upon this Assembly  We are confident, however that the good will of the people who but yesterday united without hesitation in defence of their rights and common ideals, will overcome all obstacles so that the United Nations may continue its worldwide work of peace, and that this meeting, which has opened in an atmosphere of general expectancy, may mark a further advance towards the high ideal of human concord  \\ufeffAs I am speaking in the General Assembly for the first time after having assumed the responsibilities of Secretary of State for External Affairs of my country, I should like to ask the President of the thirtyfifth session of the Assembly to accept the best wishes of the Government of the Dominican Republic, through the delegation over which I have the honour to preside Mr  President, we are convinced that, with your wisdom and your dedication to the cause of mankind, which is undoubtedly to save the nations of the Organization from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, you will guide our efforts towards the most appropriate solutions to the problems before us, which have even reached the Security Council I should also like to express to Mr  Salim Ahmed Salim our profound appreciation of his praiseworthy efforts during his presidency of the thirtyfourth session and the successive special sessions of the General Assembly We are honoured to bid the warmest welcome to the two new Members of the Organization, the Republic of Zimbabwe, a nation which has just ended a long and difficult struggle for its independence, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, whose participation in the work of the General Assembly will enrich the Group of Latin American States to which it has received a fraternal welcome From the earliest days of its independence, the Dominican Republic has on numerous occasions demonstrated heroism, courage and devotion to the rule of freedom despite the trials and tribulations to which we have been subjected throughout our history by the vicissitudes of international politics, from which we have been able to emerge with strengthened independence to the extent that it can be said that we are today perhaps one of the few countries in the world that has recovered, without foreign assistance, its status as a sovereign and independent nation, a status that was lost as a result of armed intervention which undermined its republican institutions, but, despite its duration, did not succeed in extinguishing our national spirit Consequently, we have absolute faith that the people of the Dominican Republic has reached such a degree of maturity that the idea of democracy described by Abraham Lincoln, as government of the people, by the people, and for the people, which has guided it throughout its history is now part of the soul of our nation and is fixed at the core of the defence of our continent We are a peaceloving nation which has survived the sudden reversals of fortune of internal politics over the years  Nevertheless we  maintain an unswerving policy of neutrality and nonintervention in the internal affairs of other States as the mainstay of our international relations It is nevertheless surprising that, in the face of adversity, the idea of freedom has survived in our people which, in addition to being subjected to many adverse historical circumstances, has seen various interventions and two major and long totalitarian dictatorships  But the sons of the nation of the Dominican Republic have preserved in their life as citizens this universal ethical value that is freedom, whose deep roots have never ceased to be nourished by the ideals of the selfless and courageous men who in fought long and hard to found the Dominican Republic We can be proud that for our country freedom means also the rule of law, the inherent right of men, all men without discrimination  Human rights are firmly guaranteed by our institutions  All have the right to Godgiven bread, in security and dignity  The solidarity of societies and respect for the dignity of men and nations; solidarity in the constant struggle against barbarity and organized cruelty; and, above all, the constant struggle for justice within a pure and simple democracy, without limitation—these constitute the legacy of the Divinity Within this broad context of freedom, there exist all the many responsibilities that have been assumed by the present Government of the Dominican Republic—but it cannot be denied that ever since the end of the last dictatorship, which lasted for years until  our nation has been shaped and influenced by those dictatorial policies and a civil war, in an intermediate period which preceded the normality prevailing today In contrast, we have now moved towards the rule of law and the mobilization of our citizens to foster the exploitation of all the resources of our country, notwithstanding the hurricanes which struck in and more recently, hurricane Allen We have come a long way in that direction and we are now laying the foundations for a new agararian policy  We are mobilizing all available resources to speed up development, which should lead to greater economic and financial stability We are also expanding international relations with a new vision of closer relations with other nations and a more practical approach to problems, characterized by the signature of bilateral instruments, as is to be expected of a modern society  We are promoting common interests, open markets, reasonable terms to foster joint investments and other similar programmes which should contribute to a better use of labour and the reduction of unemployment in both urban and rural areas Furthermore, we are making progress in the communication media, and this is necessary to achieve a bloodless labour revolution, individual security and freedom of the press and all means of expression of thought which is so unlimited that it can appear at times to be excessive, and this is easy to understand when one has experienced limitations on such rights during abnormal periods in the past During the past two years of our new Government, we have also become convinced that new trends in international affairs require that States not be bound by the glories of the past or wallow in sterile resentment over negative historical events  Only by meeting that requirement can unprofitable isolation be avoided  Progress must be sought in the opposite direction, by endeavouring to promote international relations of a kind that can open the way to understanding, solidarity and peace among nations With this new opening up of our international policies, the Government of the Dominican Republic has entered a new period of its history in which it has realistic friendly relations with the Republic of Haiti, a neighbour of ours with whom we share—perhaps uniquely in the world— dominion over one island Encouraged by these new ideas, the island policy that we now have with our sister country has been strengthened with every passing day, and this has created new opportunities for cultural, social and economic exchanges which we hope will lead to the signing of constructive instruments  This will surely lead to the creation of markets more in keeping with the realities of our situation and will provide better opportunities for the achievement of our mutual goals Within this economic and commercial pattern, a very promising convention on trade between the two countries has been signed  It includes a freetrade zone which applies to products produced in each country, and many facilities will ensue from that  We have scheduled reductions of import taxes on products which are specifically defined in the first and second lists annexed to that convention  Under the same instrument a permanent commission is established to determine which products will be the subject of negotiations, to propose lists of selected products, and to change the schedule for customs reductions  All this is marked by reasonable flexibility No less important is the convention on land transportation, which is to guarantee permanent communications between the supply centres and the consumption centres, and this covers products which are used in trade and is intended to promote friendship among fraternal countries in the spirit of international cooperation A new page in the history of our countries began on May  when Antonio Guzman and JeanClaude Duvalier embraced each other for the first time in Jimani Malpasse  From that time on our two nations realized that there was nothing to fear and that a new era was dawning— just as another era ended years ago—and it is an era without heroes perhaps but one also without martyrs Ever since the first nonindigenous settlers on both sides of the island began to fight for dominion over the island, our peoples had lived in only one of three ways: confronting each other, with their backs turned to each other or on top of each other  That was until the arrival of Antonio Guzman and JeanClaude Duvalier  Now our two peoples, under the leadership of these two statesmen, have begun a new life: a life of friendship, good will and cooperation, to quote the words, the firm intentions expressed by Antonio Guzman when he welcomed JeanClaude Duvalier, the President of Haiti, at JimaniMalpasse Friendship, good will and cooperation are the ABC of the foreign policy of President Guzman with regard to Haiti and that of President Duvalier with regard to the Dominican Republic  Instead of confrontation, instead of hostile indifference, there is today, along with a firm desire to work, a determination to live in peace as blood brothers These are glad tidings that I bring to the Assembly  The Dominican Republic is no longer an enemy of Haiti, and Haiti has ceased to be an enemy of the Dominican Republic  If we look at the truth, our peoples have never truly been enemies  Those who have been enemies have been a few of the men that have led our peoples  While the powerful of yesterday chose war, those in power today have chosen peace  The gloom that marked relations between the two countries has been replaced by a ray of light  Between the two nations today not only do we have peace, tranquillity and good understanding, but the future is bright This great reunion shows that there is no reason for peoples to commit aggression or to destroy themselves in war over problems which could be resolved in a civilized manner  Now with firm steps—although they are often slow ones because of the precariousness of our resources—we are waging an allout battle against the common enemy of our peoples, the implacable adversary of the developing countries: poverty  It is poverty that prevents us from developing spiritually, politically, economically and socially in human dignity We have made these references to our relations with the Haitian people and Government, one of the aspects of our present policy, which is in keeping with the international norms which the Charter of the United Nations advocates within the philosophy of peace keeping, which more than ever requires a concerted solution to disputes and conflicts, in which dialogue must be prominent  It is the best and most effective way in which States can deal with each other in this decade In this context, progress has been made, but backward steps also have been taken  Now there is more reason than ever before to act positively, for international terrorism in many forms has been the source of disturbance and has undermined international public order, creating an alarming situation; that phenomenon increasingly is at variance with human rights, which must prevail if we are aware of the implications of a nuclear war—which could be caused by an unbridled arms race—when terrifying weapons of destruction are used which push the outlook for peace further away in our uncertain future It is certainly disturbing—for those reasons—that terrorism, far from being in decline, is gaining ground in certain very sensitive areas  For various sociological reasons, it has been more intense  Hence, we must be alert  States must stand together in a common effort to end this violence wherever it may rear its ugly head and create a threat to the States themselves In the past few years international terrorism has taken on a particularly heinous form  My delegation is referring to seizures for the purpose of economic exploitation  Frequently the pretext used is the fight for freedom, but that is often not the true purpose  It is mere lust for money  This is an international crime which cannot be justified and cannot remain unpunished My country has been tested by such events  They represent a return to savagery which smacks of medieval obscurantism and constitute a challenge and a threat to our country and our institutions We have ourselves suffered the unfortunate experience of that form of terrorism that uses as weapons the seizure and holding of hostages, who are the innocent and the defenceless victims of that wanton crime Fortunately, our national dignity has remained unscathed by such trials and we have emerged from them without bloodshed  Such would not have been the case had common sense and providence not intervened in a timely manner We cannot fail to condemn the repugnant spectacle of human beings held in long captivity in Iran simply because they belong to an institution which is hundreds of years old, the institution of diplomacy that makes possible legal relations among States and without which the world would be uninhabitable International instruments that punish and prevent such crimes have been referred to here in the General Assembly  A few years ago, when aircraft were being seized and their passengers exposed to risks, the Dominican Republic and Brazil agreed that such criminal acts must be considered as transgressions of juris gentium because preventive action is difficult When we speak of international terrorism in all its forms as a scourge, we cannot fail also to advocate the elimination of certain legal excesses in which States have engaged in order to repress, exceeding the limits of domestic law and affect the rights of others  In that line of thought, our delegation shares the view of those who believe that human rights are absolute  This is not open to challenge; it is enshrined in international law  One of the great achievements of our time is that such rights are a part of juris gentium and they have become part of that law because violations of human rights can lead to conflicts For these reasons, the Dominican Republic also advocates the abolition of capital punishment  This must become a norm of law in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and a basic principle in the American Convention on that subject   Although this form of punishment is generally proscribed, it is permitted exceptionally in those States in which it had existed before the signing of the interAmerican instrument  Logic, since the days of the Greeks, has taught us that things cannot be and not be at the same time We are pleased to say that the Constitution of our country sets forth in one of its tenets what must one day appear in all international instruments on human rights  It states the following under that heading:The inviolability of life As a result, there must be no capital punishment, no torture nor any other penalty or procedure implying the loss or diminution of physical integrity or individual wellbeing This idea underlies the observations the Dominican Republic made concerning the American Convention on Human Rights The Dominican Republic, as it signs the American Convention on Human Rights, hopes to see the death penalty banned and that principle applied generally in the States of the American region, and we hereby reiterate the observations and comments made with regard to the draft Convention and circulated among the delegations of the Council of the Organization of American States on June In this area of human rights, our country, despite our untoward experiences in the past both under dictatorship and at other times, has achieved positive goals and will continue to work towards the rule of law These considerations would be incomplete were we to fail to recognize that those countries that are still grappling with problems that arise from an insufficient degree of development owing to insufficient economic means must promote education, without which democracy cannot survive  The five freedoms proclaimed in the Pacific region must become a reality  If this is so, we must recognize that the industrialized, fully developed countries, which makeup the established economic institutions, are in duty bound to come to the economic, technological, social and cultural assistance of the developing countries This recalls the Declaration of Algiers   We would add that this must be a commitment, not merely an expression of charity or pity  It is an unchallenged fact that today the economic ills of one State have an inevitable effect on others The thirtyfifth session of the General Assembly coincides with the beginning of a new decade, and this has a very special significance for the international economic order  It is particularly significant for the third world countries that are not oil producers, like the Dominican Republic, countries whose Governments are engaged in an allout battle against poverty in all its forms and are endeavouring to establish a society ruled by social justice and a broader and more equitable distribution of material goods, as well as to promote the enjoyment of the spiritual values so essential to human dignity and representative democracy Only a few weeks ago, the eleventh special session of the General Assembly was held to consider an international strategy for development; it is to be hoped that its conclusions will be supported by the industrialized countries, including the United States of America, Japan and the European countries  The results of those deliberations will continue to be considered in relation to general rules as well as to the global negotiations so that we may actually begin the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade The countries of the third world base their demands on the fact that the world distribution of income is very unequal and that internal efforts to improve development levels are being obstructed at the international level and are meeting external forces to minimize them  This can clearly be seen in international trade relations  The need for reform goes far beyond the liberalization achieved by the negotiations within GATT  The quota system, systems of safeguards and various forms of restrictions that affect the export of many products from developing to industrialized countries all contribute to this inequality in income distribution throughout the world and have made it impossible to establish a fair level for prices through trade machinery The industrialized countries must unhesitatingly recognize that the stabilization of commodity prices represents a reform that will help them as much as the less developed countries  For this reason, the Common Fund for Commodities, as well as the creation of a reserve fund for food grains, will benefit not only the producing but also the consumer countries through a more rational use of resources and the promotion of larger investments The violent fluctuations in the price of sugar on the world market is a striking example of the enormous difficulties which periodically beset the economies of countries like the Dominican Republic  These ups and downs create uncertainties  The International Sugar Agreement is an instrument filled with good intentions, but its effectiveness leaves much to be desired because price adjustments are not as automatic as one would wish and prices are fixed on the basis of supply, if not by speculation  In the circumstances, our economy, which depends largely on sugar exports, is in a particularly precarious state, which makes it impossible to plan resources  World inflation is making the situation even worse Consequently, it is not surprising that refinancing of the external debt looms large in the thinking of the third world countries  While it is difficult to assess the benefits refinancing would bring, it would certainly have a stabilizing effect on the financial markets and make it easier for the debtor countries to adapt'  The external debt of developing countries that do not export oil has increased from $billion in to $billion in  and in countries of Latin America alone the debt went from $billion to $billion during that same period  As the external debt increases considerably, there has been, at the same time, a large rise in private loans and a consequent reduction of official loans; higher interest rates and shorter repayment periods thus have resulted  The industrialized countries must give assistance here to the developing countries in the form of donations and loans on easy terms and with fewer conditions International cooperation for development must be extended to other areas of importance such as industrialization, the transfer of science and technology and the more rational use of natural resources, the expansion of agricultural production and the promotion of food production, as well as the protection of the environment However, if all these negotiations concerning the international economic outlook are to be productive, it is necessary for the highly industrialized countries to resolve their problems of inflation and the low growth rate of their gross national product  The less developed countries must react to the hostility of the international economic environment— which is marked by protectionist tendencies and increases in the price of petroleum—and the difficulties regarding foreign trade and growing external debts, with all the problems that that implies  For our country, the value of our oil imports this year will amount to $million; that is, $million more than it was in  as a result of the fact that the average price of a barrel of oil rose from $to $ although consumption remained the same as during the previous year The cost of payment and repayment of our debts in is estimated at $million  Therefore, those two areas alone will absorb approximately percent of our total export earnings, which are estimated at $million The Government of our country, under President Antonio Guzman, in only two years has implemented an economic programme aimed at changing our development pattern and providing incentives for agricultural and livestock development on the basis of agricultural and industrial promotion  Our import substitution programme is expected to increase along with the production and use of our national raw materials and laws that provide incentives for exportation We have tried to improve our public finances, eliminate luxury investments and above all concentrate on expanding education, health services, agricultural credits, dynamic agrarian reform, the building of secondary roads and the training of businessmen, in small and mediumsized concerns  We are developing our infrastructure through the construction of highways, irrigation channels and dams and energy development; we are endeavouring to expand promotion of the agricultural sector but an accelerated rate of implementation has been difficult owing precisely to our problems of balance of payment and foreign debt Recent statistics have been given by the United Nations and the World Bank showing that during the first years of the present decade billion people—half the people of the world—will suffer from gastrointestinal disease because the water they drink is contaminated  Yet $million is being spent every minute on weapons for war Many countries destroy food surpluses in order to keep prices high while, at the same time, four fifths of mankind is suffering from hunger and malnutrition, and does not have the basic domestic appliances to make life bearable I should like to repeat here what so many others have said here and in other forums, namely, that the enemy of peace, the one truly responsible for human misery, fanning the fire of revolution, is injustice in the broadest sense of the word, which is the abuse of authority and the exploitation of man by man  In international relations there are vastly different standards for judging others from the standards which we use to judge ourselves William Bowdler, UnderSecretary for InterAmerican Affairs in the SubCommittee on InterAmerican Affairs, speaking before the Foreign Relations Committee of the House of Representatives, reflected the thoughts of Morgen thau when he said: The real question confronting the foreign policy of the United States     is not how to preserve stability in the face of the revolutionary process but rather how to create stability as a result of revolution In my country development has been slow but it has been inexorable as the result of a genuine revolution which has gone through stages  It is a revolution through evolution  We have a Government that respects human rights  There are no limitations to free expression, except those imposed by law  Freedom of movement is a reality  There are no political prisoners  No one is persecuted for his ideas  There are no exiles  No one simply disappears  We have life in a genuine democracy and there is absolute freedom within order  We have therefore created our own stability of which Morgenthau spoke  We have done our part regarding what has been confronting the foreign policy of the United States  Thus, we have the right—and we have that right to our guaranteed stability When Mr  Bowdler accepted the change and said it was natural and inevitable, he was merely adjusting his watch in time with history  When he said that peace and democracy in our region require fundamental political and socioeconomic reforms which promote the wellbeing and strengthen the rights of the individual, he was formulating a thesis that his country can help to bring about in reality  Change and reform will serve no useful purpose if our countries receive the same unjust treatment that the powerful reserve for subjugated peoples The oil problem, which hangs like a sword over our heads, is a matter that must be dealt with by those who have the good fortune to be oil producers A new vision in our commercial relations has appeared; a new, more modern approach to justice and equity is needed If political experiments which have been translated into reality, as in the Dominican Republic, have no immediate success, we run the risk that the enemy forces that beset us will sweep us away  There are some demagogues, who affirm that democracy has already performed its historic function and that the path of the vote is the path of suicide,The peoples of the world love freedom so much, men have such an elevated concept of freedom that in my country everyone is very well aware of the precarious state in which we have been left by the forces of nature and by the devastation caused by those who went before us, and now we are working for the full enjoyment of those values of which we have spoken  The people realize with every passing day that the man whom it has chosen to guide its destiny is multiplying his efforts and will never rest until the most humble Dominican has been rescued from misery, ignorance and sorrow But the old economic disorder persists and in countries like mine, after centuries of struggle and after the people have succeeded in securing respect for their wishes, now offers us no more than freedom without bread, without adequate housing, without health and without equitable distribution If we are to speak truly of equitable distribution of the wealth of our country, it is necessary for us to speak of equitable distribution of the profits produced by our wealth for the powerful countries We must put an end to the imbalance which exists between the enterprises and those employed by enterprises  Once the labour of the workers ceases to be a mere input in large landholdings and in industry to acquire the status that it has in certain powerful countries, then can we speak of respect for human rights, of dignity for human beings Without equality there can be no fraternity, no good will  Without justice man enthusiasm and the enthusiasm of peoples for solidarity in moments of misfortune and rejoicing in times of triumph will not be aroused Aristotle said, nearly four centuries before the birth of Christ, that inequality is always the cause of revolutions  And according to the same philosopher there is inequality when those who are the victims of revolutions are not compensated But there is also inequality when, among those who contribute to the exploitation of wealth, there exists a great difference in the distribution of that wealth  There is inequality when the greatest wealth of a country is acquired by someone else for speculative purposes and when the true owners of the riches are left in a state of poverty  There is inequality when what is paid in terms of interest is greater than what is received in terms of loans  There will be inequality as long as our tourists are not given the treatment they deserve and as long as our citizens are not treated as masters in their own homes We need a vigorous energy policy such as has been launched by our President in the face of the oil crisis  For this reason studies have already begun on turning our oil burning thermoelectric plants over to coal; research work has been started on the drying of cane pulp by solar energy to increase power capacity; we are carrying out feasibility studies on the building of a megawatt electrical plant, also using solar energy; and we have intensified the search for oil in various parts of the country, and among other important studies, we are developing hydraulic energy All these efforts are designed to promote a more just and equitable society, where political democracy is based on social justice, equal opportunity and the elimination of differences between the poor and the rich  This is the greatest contribution that our country can make to the new international economic order and, in particular, to solving the problems of the Caribbean, which traditionally has been the scene of abrupt political change We should like to make a few comments regarding the situation in the Middle East, which is a highly sensitive area of conflict  In recent months the picture in that area has become even more gloomy As a Member of our world Organization, the Dominican Republic took part in the deliberations which led to the creation of the State of Israel  The basis of that historic act was the principle in the Charter on the selfdetermination of peoples  We share the view that creation of that nation was based on international law  We never failed to recognize all that the Holy Scriptures grant the people of Israel As a participant in the InterAmerican Conference on the Problems of War and Peace, held at Mexico City in when the Allied Powers saw the end of the Second World War approaching and the spirit of the Yalta agreements inspired the international community re Dominican Republic was anxious to support new visions of a more peaceful world This spirit also prevailed at the San Francisco Conference and in the debates which led to the signing of the Charter of the United Nations, which for so many years has prevented the scourge of total war and helped to preserve peace Therefore, when considering the right of Israel to survive as a sovereign State established in accordance with the principle of the selfdetermination of peoples, we cannot but honour the commitment imposed by the principles of the Charter For those reasons, we have lent our reasonable support to Israel whenever the legitimacy of that State has been challenged  For the same reasons, our country recognizes the right of the Palestinian people, without diminishing the right to existence of a people which, like Israel, has participated in the great work of peace We think that this is a just and legitimate position and we consider that peaceful means should be used to settle the situation in the Middle East  With equal conviction we view the Camp David agreements as a firm step towards peace in the Middle East, in an atmosphere of tranquillity and mutual respect and under the rule of law  In this way the States involved can live within permanent, secure and guaranteed borders The Dominican Republic, which has survived the vicissitudes of history and has always observed a policy of neutrality, believes that this is the right policy for small countries, especially developing countries, within the framework of independent sovereign democracy  Thus we cannot fail to mention Afghanistan, which is a member State of the third world movement to which we belong Because we cherish peace, we deplore the abnormal situation which has occurred there in violation of the fundamental norms of international law and the demands of peace which justify the existence of the United Nations  Consequently we believe that the situation in Afghanistan must return to the status quo ante, and by peaceful means For the same reasons, which are in keeping with the universal principles of the free nations of the world, the Government of the Dominican Republic hopes that the machinery available to the Organization will make it possible to stop the conflict between the neighbouring countries of Iran and Iraq, countries with the maturity of many centuries of experience, in order to prevent the outbreak of a total war We say this in a spirit of the strictest neutrality Let me sum up by saying that in respect for human rights and for the Organization we have an obligation to build a more just world in peace  This is what was said by His Holiness Pope John Paul II in Santo Domingo, the oldest capital in the Americas:We must see to it that there are no children who are without sufficient nutrition, without education or training; we must ensure that there are no young people who lack suitable training, that there are no peasants without land and unable to live in dignity; we must see to it that workers are not mistreated, that their rights are not violated; we must see to it that there are no systems allowing the exploitation of man by man, or by the State; there must be no corruption; there must be none who through no fault of their own have nothing while others enjoy superabundance; there must be no broken, disunited, insufficiently caredfor families; no one must be without the protection of the law; the law must protect everyone equally; force must not prevail over truth and law, but truth and law must prevail over force; we must ensure that economic and political considerations never prevail over humanitarian considerations  \\ufeffIt is a great honour and pleasure for me to return to this rostrum for the fortyfourth session of the Assembly and to address it on behalf of my country, the Dominican Republic It is also a matter of great satisfaction to me to convey to Mr  Joseph Nanven Garba the warm congratulations of the Dominican Government, and of our delegation in particular, on his welldeserved election to the presidency of this great gathering  I look forward confidently to his complete success in this sensitive undertaking inasmuch as he is a skilled and seasoned diplomat from a region which is undergoing a steady process of growth and development  a fact that can be observed in the importance and the scope of the Convention concluded between the European Economic Community and the African, Caribbean aid Pacific States, better known as the lome Convention, the progress of which we have been following in our country with much interest and with a great feeling of solidarity  His outstanding personal qualities will ensure that the work and the deliberations of this session will be guided with due deliberation and the highest aims  In this respect, he can count on our resolute cooperation This is a suitable opportunity to express our high esteem for that outstanding Argentine internationalist, Mr, Dante Caputo, for his exemplary guidance of the work of the last session On this solemn occasion we should like to place on record our great appreciation and admiration for the SecretaryGeneral of our Organization, Mr  Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the valuable, timely and unstinting work that he has been doing to promote peace and understanding among the peoples and nations of the Earth At the beginning of my statement I should like to thank the representatives for their attention to lay sincere message of goodwill from a part of the globe that has been called upon to play a major role from the time of the arrival in the New World of the visionary, the admiral of the seas Christopher Columbus, a portentous event that changed the course of history Hispaniola has had the honour of having its capital Santo Domingo, as the headquarters of the first administrative, religious, cultural, scientific and economic institutions of the American continent Fran this confluence of cultures, ethnic groups, customs and traditions on Hispaniola, the first voices were raised in defence of the indigenous races, which formed a new and juridical concept of equality and justice among human beings, through jus gentium, the law of nations, in which one can find the true roots of modern international law, and as a result, the distant origins of the international bodies designed to ensure the observance and effectiveness of the inherent rights of the human person Under that auspicious beacon, in this lofty body in which all the nations of the world are represented with their own particular characteristics, we are again meeting in a yearly pilgrimage to find peace  But this ideal, which is so difficult to express in specific terms, cannot be fully achieved unless it is by means of open and respectful, but firm and conclusive, dialogue, with a view to putting an end to terrorism and drug trafficking, in whatever form or under any pretext It is natural that any undertaking directed towards limiting the arms race and eliminating deadly weapons should be seen as a comforting and encouraging example  That is the case with respect to the agreement on the limitation of strategic weapons between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was jointly announced by Secretary of State James Baker and Minister for Foreign Affairs Eduard Shevardnadze  Special mention should be made of the plan proposed at this session of the General Assembly by the President of the United States, Mr  George Bush, to rid the Earth of the scourge of chemical weapons, a proposal that was welcomed by the Soviet Union  These positive steps, which demonstrate the will of both superPowers to reduce the causes of tension and disagreement, will have a favourable impact on world politics in the coming years Once again, I should like to recall that the Dominican Republic, a Caribbean nation, is aware that its development is indissolubly linked to that of our neighbour, Haiti, and of the other countries of the area  Our trade with those countries had been minimal despite the geographic,, ethnic, historic and economic bonds that unite us  Hence our Government has begun an energetic movement towards integration with our Caribbean brothers, since we are fully convinced that it is only by means of joint, united efforts that we shall achieve the goals that will bring us full development for our peoples With regard to the tragic situation in Central America, our country reiterates that it is interested in cooperating in the search for a speedy and most fitting solution of this conflict  We categorically support the agreements that have been entered into in the search for peace by the five Central American Presidents – the Esquipulas II Agreements and the Playa del Tesoro Declarations  aimed at achieving a peaceful negotiated solution to the Central American crisis  The recent Tela presidential summit demonstrates that there is hope that peace can be achieved, for peace is the essential prerequisite for the solution of the political, economic and social problems of the region The Dominican Republic has noted with particular interest the events occurring throughout Africa, not only because of its impact on international policies, but also because the African race is part of our own ethnic and cultural substratum  We stand in solidarity with the African peoples and participate in efforts to solve their problems, which are similar to those facing all developing countries  The situation in southern Africa continues to be explosive, with unforeseeable consequences for peace and security in the area; its prolongation has an impact on international stability Security Council resolution ( contains the basic elements for a just and lasting solution of the question of Namibia  For almost years the South African apartheid regime has been illegally occupying the Territory, in defiance of all the relevant United Nations resolutions  We defend Namibia fundamental right to selfdetermination  The delegation of the Dominican Republic believes that the system of government in South African breeds violence, injustice, oppression, inequality and discrimination  in other words, everything that flies in the face of the ideals behind the founding of the United Nations  The eradication of apartheid and independence for Namibia will create the necessary conditions for a return to peace in southern Africa  We call for the cessation of the growing hostilities between Syrian forces and Lebanese Christian soldiers  Despite this escalation, the efforts for peace that have begun recently give us hope for a definitive solution of the conflict The situation in the Middle East, which is of great concern to all nations of the world, has a direct impact on Dominicans, because among our ethnic groups there are many people with Palestinian, Syrian, Arab and Israeli roots, with the resultant influence they bring to our national life The Dominican Republic has been concerned for several years about the situation in the Korean peninsula  Our country has supported the view that Korean affairs must be solved peacefully by means of dialogue between the two Koreas  The Republic of Korea must be admitted to membership in the United Nations in keeping with the principle of universality  Its entry into the Organization would contribute to reducing tension and promoting peace in northeastern Asia  The Dominican Republic has viewed favourably the formula for the unification of the Korean community that was proposed recently by the Government of the Republic of Korea to promote peaceful coexistence between the south and the north of Korea The serious and tragic situation in many developing nations makes it imperative for us urgently to adopt effective and concrete measures to improve the living conditions of millions in the third world  The presence in this important gathering of a growing number of Heads of State or Government from those countries is clear proof of the worldwide interest and expectations regarding the results and conclusions of this session, which has also brought together representatives of the most powerful and developed countries of the world The situation of the nations of the third world is so critical and paradoxical that their economies are constantly stagnating or actually deteriorating  There will be no improvement until more favourable conditions are provided for access by our export products to the developed countries' markets  If that goal is achieved, and if the developing countries receive better treatment in negotiations regarding their external debt from the creditor nations and entities, we shall have an opportunity, with the impetus of this necessary cooperation, to embark energetically and optimistically upon the path of our development Thus, it is obvious that the solution to the general problem of the external debt cannot be achieved with the ways and means that have been used to date, since in most cases they do not allow for economic growth and therefore subject peoples to impoverishment and social upheaval The international community, aware of the intricate nature of this problem, which is not merely economic in nature, recognizes that the United Nations has the competence to seek a solution in the political sphere The position of the Dominican Republic was defined graphically by His Excellency Mr  Joaquin Balaguer, the President of the Dominican Republic, in his speech at the opening meeting of the Twelfth Annual Conference on Investment, Trade and Development, held in Miami, in the United States, in November of  He said: The goal set forth in Berlin for the thirdworld countries is not to pay the public debt but, above all, to achieve sustained economic growth and an increase in percapita income that will guarantee our dispossessed masses the right to eat, to clothe themselves, to educate their children and to live under a decent roof  In other words, the thirdworld countries face two challenges  not one, as was said in Berlin  The first is to live; the second, to pay Since terrorism continues to affect all nations to such a degree and with such tragic and disastrous consequences, sowing fear and insecurity, a strong, internationally coordinated plan must be adopted to combat it more firmly and thereby ensure its eradication  One of the most criminal and frequent forms of terrorist action is the attacks against passengers, flights and airports  Such attacks are increasingly stirring the universal conscience The Dominican Republic strongly condemns the subversive activities of international terrorism, which is carried out indiscriminately against mothers, innocent children and the ill  in other words, against life itself, the most precious thing we own The alarming problem of drugs has reached such dimensions, it terms both of production and of trade and consumption, that our delegation wishes to place it on record that the Dominican Government is struggling with all the means in its power to deal with this social evil that is spreading like a flood  For that purpose our courts have been imposing increasingly severe sentences on drug traffickers  Publicity has been given to this throughout the country with a view to ensuring that drug users and traffickers are aware of it and that people understand the evil and disastrous consequences of this illegal trade We also give our moral support to the battle which is being waged by countries throughout the continent and whose development we are following with great interest At this difficult historical time of conflict, with acute, burning problems that I have mentioned in this statement  to which my colleagues in the Assembly have been good enough to listen with attention  there have been signs of detente and an improvement in international relations above and beyond diverse criticism or positions  I should like to express on behalf of the Government that I have the honour of representing and on my own behalf, our fervent desire to see concrete form given to the ideals and principles that led to the establishment of the world Organization, in which mankind has placed its hopes for a better future in which the ethical and spiritual values that underlie our civilization prevail   All the Americas welcome with pride and enthusiasm the honour which this distinguished Assembly has just conferred on one of the American continent’s most illustrious sons, Mr  Emilio Arenales, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guatemala, by electing him its President for the twentythird session  On this great occasion I am happy to convey the homage and goodwill of the Government and people of the Dominican Republic, and their sincere affection, to one who in bringing honour to his own country also enhances the prestige of his fellows of the Americas   Mr  Emilio Arenales is a statesman of firmly democratic persuasion and deep moral convictions; an ardent believer in the ideal of justice proclaimed by the United Nations  There can be no doubt that under his able guidance the twentythird session of the General Assembly will achieve substantial successes adding to the stature of the international community, which finds its highest expression in this Assembly  We pray fervently and with reverent humility that by the grace of God, our President may be enabled fully to meet the enormous responsibilities we have placed upon his learning, his wisdom, his poise and his prudence   I am quite sure that not only our President, but all of us who are assembled here and in some degree symbolize the aspirations of millions of human beings need the guiding light of God’s Providence; for this twentythird session of the General Assembly is beginning its work in a disquieting atmosphere of political unrest mainly deriving from dangerous backgrounds of economic and social frustration  There is nothing easy in the task which faces us, but the difficulties must nevertheless be overcome  We must direct our efforts towards that allimportant end even though we are bound to give warning that noone must expect us to produce a miraculous potion capable of curing forthwith all the material and spiritual ills afflicting the less fortunate peoples and individuals  However, we are fully aware that, while there are no magic formulae for more effectively helping the needy, there is no justification, either, for indolence or any failure to meet responsibility on the part of those of us whose solemn duty it is to raise aloft and to defend the banner of justice  The Government and people of the Dominican Republic, responsive to the dictates of conscience, have therefore sent their representatives to attend the twentythird session of the General Assembly in the most vehement desire to help to find solutions leading towards worldwide concord founded upon the legitimate right to subsistence and on the mutual respect that must prevail between men and between nations  This lofty aim of concord is surely of the essence of both multinational and of strictly and exclusively national endeavour  At all events, it is reasonable to assert that world peace, founded on the right to subsistence begins and finds its most dramatic expression specifically at the national level  This means that in the long run the concord we so painstakingly seek through centres of international discussion must necessarily proceed from what we are individually able to do in this respect within our own local borders   This is one of the bases in which the policy of the constitutional Government of the Dominican Republic is anchored  We very firmly believe that we contribute to the attainment of mankind’s highest aims to the extent to which we are able to promote justice in all its manifold forms within our own frontiers  Starting from this premise, I can state emphatically that in the Dominican Republic, a country which in recent years has repeatedly suffered the blows of fate, a process of change at depth has begun that is inspired precisely by the ideal which imbues the thinking of this august Assembly  All the machinery of my country’s Government is deeply involved in this endeavour under the guidance of the Head of State, His Excellency Mr  Joaquín Balaguer, a man whose outstanding moral qualities are recognized even by his political opponents  His personal capacities, together with his acknowledged intellectual ability and his keen sense of social values, are the human qualities underlying the implementation of a policy of rehabilitation and betterment in a community in whose least conspicuous strata there are restless stirrings and the germs of political strife proliferate  This national effort is our contribution to peace  We come to this austere meetingplace with a message of brotherhood and positive willingness to understand, for the purpose of calmly and impartially weighing the vital problems which the agenda places before us for consideration  But we must acknowledge that we are deeply concerned at the continued existence in various parts of the world of focal points of conflict and areas of tension which may burst into flame at any moment and none of which it has been found possible to eliminate or reduce since the previous—last year’s—session of this Assembly  Nevertheless, we are even more concerned and disturbed to note that in addition to our having made only very slow progress towards the political problems which confronted us last year, the power of violence has in recent times reverted to its most primitive form of expression in violation of law  We deeply deplore the offences committed against the international rule of law  World society now possesses legal instruments which very firmly proscribe unilateral action  The United Nations system, with its Charter that is law for all Member States, is precisely the machinery through which disputes liable to disturb international peace should be adjusted, and is also the altar to which all States must bow before undertaking any unilateral action endangering or menacing the peace of nations  I do not need to enumerate for purposes of casuistry the discouraging examples that distress those of us who are convinced and active advocates of a system in which peace prevails in a relationship of justice  We should merely like to recall that the fact that we have subscribed to the fundamental principles of United Nations as a means of settling relationships among States places us under an ineluctable duty to be faithful servants of law as well  It is for this reason that the Government and people of the Dominican Republic do not wish to point an accusing finger at anyone, but wish to exhort all Governments and peoples here represented to join with us in an act of firm and sincere dedication to strengthening the pillars which sustain Our Organization  Let us not, like Hercules, unleash the forces of unreason to weaken those pillars, for if we do so we shall all, without exception, run the risk of being crushed under the weight of moral and material collapse  International peace is the supreme purpose of the United Nations, but the United Nations itself is the sum of the political wills of all the individual States  My Government strongly supports the conciliatory efforts now proceeding in certain parts of the world; in particular it supports the mission of Ambassador Jarring, Special Representative of the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, in pursuance of Security Council resolution ( of November  which calls upon the parties in dispute to negotiate  We cannot conceal the concern with which we view the worsening of the situation in the Middle East  In the same way we think it a great pity that so wellmeaning an initiative as that recently taken by President Johnson in the matter of the conflict in VietNam should not yet have achieved the result for which the free world was hoping  I am convinced by the teachings of history that behind the great dissensions between men and between nations there is always within reach, if the parties seek justice, a way to find an honourable solution to the most difficult problems and I therefore trust that the official talks in Paris between the United States and North VietNam will not disappoint the hopes that have been placed in this important step towards the achievement ofworld peace  It is disheartening to note that the past year has produced no favourable changes in connexion with the situation in Southern Rhodesia  My Government therefore maintains the views on this subject which it expressed during the twentysecond session of the General Assembly h meeting, in  I said earlier that I bring to this Assembly a message of brotherhood from the Government and people of the Dominican Republic  Before concluding, I wish to convey to the delegations here present cordial greetings from the delegation of the Dominican Republic, the Chairman of which delegation I have the honour to be  In particular, I should like to express to the delegation of the Republic of China my sincere thanks for the kindnesses shown to me by the high authorities of that country when I paid an official visit to Formosa in May of this year  Small countries like mine, which cannot use the language of force to ensure respect for their national integrity and their right to work out their destiny in accordance with democratic principles and the ideals upheld by the free countries of the world, have no means of asserting their international legal personality other than the vast field of high moral strategy of “consensual right, the ultimate basis of relations among States  In saying this I am not thinking only of the inflamed condition of today’s international political scene, but much more of the fact borne out by history, that rights trampled on with impunity lead to further, more profound and more dangerous violations liable to affect us all  Accordingly, although the repudiation of the civilized nations of the world is implicit, I feel bound, because my sense of justice has been offended, to include in these general considerations the feelings so summarized, of the Dominican people when faced with the anomalous situation recently created in Czechoslovakia    Mr  President, in the name of brotherhood, for which the Dominican Republic is striving, and on behalf of the Government of my country, which is honored to be one of the founding Members of the United Nations, allow me to express to you our congratulations on your being elected to the presidency of the General Assembly, which we trust you will direct with your wellknown wisdom, which has earned you a reputation as a statesman and as one who is respectful of the principles of our Organization, which provides protection for all men and peoples under the provisions of our Charter  We are confident that, guided by your knowledge and by the prestige which you will impart to our debates and deliberations, the twentysixth session of the General Assembly will have special historic significance, because here we will achieve the progress which has long been anxiously awaited and we feel sure that we will take one more step towards the rule of law for which we are all, as Member States, equally responsible On this happy occasion, allow me also to express our best wishes for the success of this important session, and at the same time I should like to extend a hearty welcome to the new States of Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar, which have come to swell the membership of this universal Organization Finally, my country wishes to pay a wellearned tribute to SecretaryGeneral U Thant for his outstanding work in the lofty post which he now holds We, the representatives who have gathered together here at the twentysixth session, are filled with concern over those matters which were not resolved at the past sessions  Now we are equipped with the means and instruments provided by the United Nations system, which should make it possible for us to meet the needs of the international community Understandably enough, many of the issues which have been held over without any progress having been made are such as to require that we overcome considerable difficulties, though these matters deserve priority and they are problems which require judicious compromise and the reconciliation of divergent ideas and the passing of time, although we must not act at variance with principles or in violation of the rules of law to which we owe our respect It is impossible really to disregard presentday realities, because no rule of law can on its own first lay the groundwork and then achieve the victory which we so ardently desire; for human justice is imperfect, like all the works of man, but it is capable of bringing about confidence and assurance among men and nations Towards the middle of our century, scarcely five years after the Organization was founded in San Francisco, an invisible divisive factor emerged which was sufficiently powerful to impede progress towards the objectives of the Charter  I am referring to the international tension which at that time began to increase to such an extent that we can now say that we are all men and peoples caught in its web  So it was that we entered what has come to be called the cold war, of which the Members of this world Organization have not been able to rid themselves  It is neither difficult to recognize this phenomenon nor easy to control it, for it has so frequently come to hold sway and has even at times caused us to question the utility of our Organization, which is in fact a forum where all the nations of the world may come together to resolve their difficulties  At least, that is what our Organization should be, but the truth is that we wish to achieve perfection, when the human mind cannot fully comprehend what perfection is  We wish to create a perfect society, whereas human perfection does not exist; and, because it does not exist, we rebel and inevitably we yield to the tensions which now beset us  The end result is really only those negative factors which we wished to avoid by creating our Organization and by fulfilling the commitments which we entered into when we became Members of our Organization  This is the agony of our time It is for this reason that on the limited horizons of men and nations has arisen the specter of war and of revolutions which seem capable of creating a new world; but we seem to have forgotten that we are living in the best of all possible worlds and that the real crisis is that we must reshape our world and bring it into hue with the needs of communities and other changes which have affected most of the things in which we placed our trust when we were as yet uninfluenced by the new forces and pressures which have been the inevitable result of progress and the advancement of civilization With the unbridled development of technology, whose visage may yet appear hideous, man has conquered space, and he has also simply been able to survive, to progress and change things but he has at the same time created voids which, it seems, he may not be able to fill In the midst o' the agony and confusion which surrounds us we are tempted at times to blame the world for the ills of mankind  But we should not forget that mankind is man; and man goes on, for without man, with all his virtues and all his shortcomings, there can exist no communities or peoples,The States Members of this Organization which came into existence as a result of the complex event of victory were confident that it would be able to resolve all the problems of the family of nations, all the crises, all the demands, all the quarrels  However, this shift in responsibility has given rise to disillusionment, whereas in reality only an insignificant period of time has elapsed  We have entered a period of crisis in law, which is constantly being forged so as to keep pace with events which occur at the same speed that classical ideas which we clung to for many centuries have evolved New ways out of this crisis must be found and new changes in law and international politics must be made, so that the United Nations may be given the necessary instruments, after years of existence, to discharge more effectively its mandate to maintain peace and preserve mankind from the scourge of war But nothing can be achieved in this direction if we in this Organization stand in the way of change, which is so urgently needed  At times it would even appear that the requirements of change are at variance with efforts being made in this world forum, and this has given rise to the terrible paradox that whereas on the one hand we wish to maintain confidence in our resolutions and recommendations, on the other hand we are reluctant to bow to our Organization dictates or to follow the guidelines laid down for emerging from the period of stagnation which, it seems, we have been in for many years I would venture to hope that, as a result of this session of the General Assembly, our Organization will emerge strengthened  It is to be hoped that it will find, and perhaps also take, the necessary steps to eliminate those obstacles which stand in the way of the smooth functioning of our Organization and its dependent bodies, and we must take a more pragmatic and universal approach to events which give rise to disputes, lack of confidence, suspicion and, to put it quite bluntly, conflicts It is for this reason that we wished, first of all, to refer to the idea of a system of international security, for which the Government of the Dominican Republic, at the twentyfourth session of the General Assembly, expressed support  It is also for this reason that we gave favorable consideration to the report of the SecretaryGeneral on the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [A/and Add,  If we could add new achievements to our record, it is likely that faith in the United Nations might increase, that distrust among nations would disappear as well as international tension, which is what has disrupted so far the kind of cooperation which must exist among nations if there is to be solidarity and interdependence  And these are the ideals which have not yet found practical expression in spite of efforts to preserve peace in all quarters of the world and to ensure that all peoples will have a right to the common heritage of security, without which we might all return to a period which existed before our present civilization, perhaps even to a time of barbarity  If we could only make progress on these lines, that would surely go a long way towards the settlement of many items on our agenda Unquestionably, putting an end to the armaments race and using those astronomical sums for social and economic improvements in nations would be one of the most effective ways of ensuring security The arms race and military expenditures are also dealt with in the report of the SecretaryGeneral, and these matters deserve the consideration of Member States of this Organization  We realize, however, that this is one of the thorniest and most controversial problems  It concerns most the major Powers, although the considerable sums being expended everywhere in the world to maintain military forces and modern weapons constitute one of the greatest obstacles to economic and social progress, which is so sorely needed because of the changes to which I have referred  But these needs have been ignored so frequently whenever we have reached a standstill on the question of disarmament or considered an end to the arms race, or even a truce in atomic tests and many other related matters which we can scarcely overlook The Latin American countries, through their respective heads of State, set forth their positions in Punta del Este in April with regard to the need to reduce these military budgets, for the same reasons  And the same kind of recommendations were put forward with firm conviction and determination at the General Assembly of the Organization of American States in San Jose, Costa Rica, from to April of this year On this subject we cannot fail to endorse the words of a Latin American statesman in San Francisco during the tenth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter, when he said:We have faith and confidence in the United Nations because we hope that its labors will give the world a better future and will create an atmosphere of security and tranquility for the fruitful work and the utilization of scientific achievements, which will permit spiritual and physical wellbeing, progress and general welfare, That faith is unshakable and my country will therefore do its utmost v as it has done in the past, to cooperate in completing the vast task still before us We realize that not everything depends upon the United Nations alone The world is now divided into such divergent camps that the United Nations has very often not been in a position to apply its full strength to the completion of Hie task it had begun, a task which would redound to the benefit of mankind That being th  situation, we must face the problem squarely and speak frankly  All this has special relevance to the problems on our agenda, to which I now wish to refer On more than one occasion we have felt it appropriate to refer to the views of our Government on the policy of apartheid, especially during tills International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination Ever since the debate in San Francisco that gave rise to our Organization my country has advocated the elimination of discrimination, and we voted in favor of the principles on this subject contained in the Charter That occurred more than a quartercentury ago, and what was stated then, in our view, is not restrictive, but we should now spell out what we meant at the time if we are to create the same kind of awareness today as impelled nations at the time to subscribe to these human principles  We shall thus be able to deal with new forms of discrimination which have ccn>e about in the course of the changing lives of men and peoples, and which we trust we have reflected in this statement Governments are the concrete manifestation of the State, and peoples are an essential element of nations, and very frequently they must suffer from the consequences of discrimination, which violate one natural sense of justice and are at odds with the principle of solidarity , for without a desire for justice and solidarity it is difficult to understand why nations would have been willing to become Members of this Organization and work together for progress and peace  That is why we are bound here to speak about a general pattern of discrimination among countries great and small that are Members of the United Nations  between small countries that are Members of the Organization and others that are not yet members and between small Member States and others that have only recently taken on an independent juridical existence after having been dependent Territories and that have become independent in accordance with the processes and procedures laid down by the Charter  A few from this latter category of mmII States, which became independent in accordance with generally accepted principles, have now come to be known disrespectfully as miniStates This is not only a discriminatory attitude; it offends the very peoples we wish to support, but what is even more unacceptable is that It seems to suggest that some States can be both independent and not independent at one and the same time We are opposed to that kind of discrimination  We do not support it and it should not exist at a time when, thanks to certain ideas which have emerged after many centuries of preparation, the advocates of many religions who were previously at loggerheads can now sit down together at the same table Oecumenical congresses have shown that divergent views can live together, that isms can be reconciled, and that ultimately everyone will favors the commonweal and recognizes our historic destiny We see no reason, then, to allow any infringement of the principle of universality in the United Nations, which is the community of communities, more earthly than divine My delegation believes that it is quite realistic, then, to maintain our policy on apartheid We think that firm policy applies to other matters alsofor example, economic, social and technological discrimination; and any monopoly on science, which is also a way of holding up human progress  We would go still further, though we may be accused of going too far and advocating ideals that are impracticable, like many of the structures of Plato Republic But today world teaches us that ideals are made a reality as a result of momentum provided by progress, which cannot be stopped  And we must realize that ideals are the greatest good man is heir to  So it is that today we may proudly say that man has set foot on the moon, and he may indeed go still further if he pursues his intention to conquer outer spaceas one may readily anticipate from recent events We trust we are not in error inasmuch as one of the items on our agenda concerns precisely international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space, which produced General Assembly resolution (XXV) This matter has a relation, direct or indirect, to the formal note we submitted to the SecretaryGeneral when celebrating the twentyfifth anniversary of our Organization  In that document we recommended a study of ways and means for depoliticizing outer space, which is another way of setting aside special areas or reserves for peaceful purposes We therefore cannot fail to welcome the inclusion of item on our agenda which corresponds to that resolution In line with our request to the SecretaryGeneral, which followed the highest  channels, we are pleased that in this Assembly there has emerged the idea of international cooperation in the peaceful use of outer space My delegation supports item of the agenda  The Dominican Republic is a party to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (the Treaty of Tlatelolco)  We sincerely believe that it is possible to denuclearize the area constituted by the countries of Latin America  We have no reason to assume that an instrument calling for the creation of a nuclearfree zone to ensure that mankind will not disappear from the face of the earth can produce any undesirable effects, for such a zone would come to be a kind of enormous sanctuary against what is mankind most frightening invention, frightening unless used for peaceful purposes, unless used to safeguard and not to destroy th* human race My delegation supports the idea of using, with discrimination against no one, the resources of the seabed and the ocean floor without infringing on the jurisdictional limits of States, for the benefit of mankind in the future, although we do believe that, until certain matter* that might be termed preliminary questions are resolved, and until genuinely exhaustive studies are carried out on the proposed planning, and until a positive awareness has been created among all States Members of the United Nations as regards the importance of bringing all parties into the agreement, whether Members of the United Nations or not, it will not be possible to reach agreement; and without goodwill, the instruments necessary for those objectives would remain without the necessary ratifications, as has occurred in the case of so many other conventions the ratification of which has for so many years been urged by the SecretaryGeneral It is our hope that all difficulties and obstacles standing in the way of such grand and laudable objectives will gradually give way and disappear, and that we shall succeed in getting off to a fresh start in a task which cannot be achieved in a single effort but may require several further attempts, as we know from experience Those nations that have achieved incredible levels of technology, the Powers that have been able to say that they have the earth satellite within their reach, thought only of reaching the nearest stage, but none was so pointlessly bold as to try to go beyond that  This is precisely what we should do in so exciting a task as the reservation for exclusively peaceful purposes of the seabed and ocean floor, and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction But this should not be taken to imply that at the present time we occupy a negative position and that we do not recognize that possibilities exist for us, as we have always done, to cooperate in anything that may redound to the benefit of the progress and welfare of mankind We do not wish to take a hard and fast position when considering practices that affect human development and the protection of all rights that are or should be juridically protected Whenever we have had occasion to consider the matter of human rights, we have been overtaken by the thought that someone may take upon himself the privilege of casting the first stone  Our hesitancy in the matter, which seems to us reasonable when dealing with questions iii the Assembly that affect States Members of our Organization or other States, stems from our conviction that certain kinds of violations are a common sin committed by a great number of nations in various geographical areas of the world, and not in one area only For this reason, we would be more pleased to see the item concerning the violation of human rights considered as a matter that concerns us all, indivisibly  Accordingly, we should like to see the studies carried out on subject of massive violations considered in tern We do not believe that these important questions should concern only certain presumed violators, while not even remotely concerning others  The facts of this matter have she ^'n that frequently the very ones who are at fault are eager to point an accusing finger at their neighbor, and even beyond their neighbor Quite frequently, in both small and large States, there have been violations of th* right of free transit from the homeland to another land where the people involved believe that they will have greater opportunities or a better life for themselves and for their children We have willingly, or almost willingly, remained inactive in the face of actions that could be termed improper in connexion with prisoners of war; and even more inexplicably, in the face of the lack or near lack of provision for the exchange of prisoners or for the praiseworthy activities of the International Red Cross In some of these situations events have shown that there has been disregard for conventions and international rules which are based unquestionably on the rule of la w and human rights These then are multilateral obligations which are contained in instruments, or regional or international declarations   On this occasion we cannot fail to put forward a few views on the existence of the Republic of China in the world Organization  For more than two decades we have given our support on this matter, which has become especially controversial in the General Assembly in the past three years  We are aware of the changes which have occurred in international politics recently,When we signed the Charter we were aware that in spite of the fact that the United Nations had been created by the victorious States, even well before the end of the last world war, the major Powers were thinking in terms of the need to concert their efforts before agreeing on a peace treaty or a system which would ban or at least remove the causes and chances of a new allout war, which might pose a threat to present civilization The victorious Powers* as long ago as that, glimpsed the possibility of establishing, with peoples opposing war and cherishing peace peoples who either witnessed or were involved in the greatest catastrophe which, the world had ever seen, and by man own doing a systematic organization where as a result of the rule of law a remedy might be found to the ills which led to the scourge of war In view of these undeniable realities there was an awareness of collective needs which led to the creation of our Organization, open to all and within a spirit of justice There was discrimination, to be sure, against the conquered at that time  But with the passage of time the dark clouds which then existed have since disappeared There has emerged in our Organization the concept of universality; the right of participation in our Organization by all peoples attached to peacea just peaceand not to war banned by law, has come to be recognized  Our Organization has a tremendous responsibility to ensure the smooth functioning of the international community at all times  That is why we have always questioned the admission of any Member or the rehabilitation of a Member when it has not met the essential requirements of membership of this Organization  That is the basic provision of Article  paragraph  of the Charter In the circumstances we have always come out in favor of certain principles and accordingly we have never failed Co repudiate all forms of aggression, as required also by the Charter, which it is our duty to support We are saying this on behalf of a Member State whose pages of political history reflect the wounds and scars that were caused by failure to respect in  principles proclaimed in San Francisco and generally held to this day We know from our own experience just how great the price of peace can be, We are also aware of our great duty to support international solidarity and other values which are equally deserving of respect by all States, It is the duty of all of us to review our positions and to open the door to conciliation and the uncertainties of the future so that we may, with or without skepticism but at least courageously, abandon old traditional patterns to which we have become committed With these comments by way of an introduction, we are now prepared to turn to fr subject we have mentioned  We hold the view that the Republic of China should continue as a Member of this Organization  But in order for that to be so, the Dominican Republic at this crossroads is prepared to compromise when necessary We should also like to comment now on the subject of action to be taken against nazism and other totalitarian ideologies and practices Our country is one which had a dictatorship for more than years  Our people back in the nineteenth century were considered to be one of the most bellicose in the world  We were a courageous and vigorous people who achieved independence with frequent displays of heroism thanks to the sole efforts of its sons  We have been able to survive as a free and sovereign State in spite of the many trials which we have been subjected to  Only six years have passed since one of the most terrible revolutions ended, which disrupted the entire social and legal structure of the Dominican Republic We are quite confident that at all times we have discharged the mandate which was conferred on us when we solemnly declared here that not only the Government which is represented here but also all the people of our nation reject not only nazism and other totalitarian ideologies and practices, but all forms of totalitarianism, open or covert  Our country will vote in all circumstances in keeping with these convictions  We also believe that we are in this way acting strictly in accordance with one of the most important principles of the Constitution of our Republic Another matter which we cannot fail to refer to is the situation in the Middle East We have briefly considered the question of the necessary reconciliation of all peoples and the need to give momentum to the means at the disposal of our Organization to remove anomalous situations which stand in the way of harmony in the world We have always believed that direct negotiations can point the way to goals which at times have seemed unattainable  This method is probably as old as man himself, and it can be effective whenever there has been a willingness to use instruments which reflect the mandates which have been given to the General Assembly and the Security Council As Members of the Organization, we have given our moral support to Security Council resolution ( and to the Jarring mission  We believe that the door to a settlement satisfactory to all parties is still open  But we believe that in all conflicts or disputes peaceful action is always possible if the unassailable truth that negotiating means persuading, dissuading and compromising is recognized  Similarly, mutual sacrifices are necessary The United Nations Conference for Trade and Development is also a matter of keen interest to our country and this is only natural for this is required if we are to do away with underdevelopment, a matter which we have so frequently discussed We can say confidently that in recent years we have done a good deal to get out of this impasse, for at the present time a great number of productive forces have been brought together at home and abroad for the common good  This is a contribution made by one and all and not by just a few, and all parties involved have been active  We must all pursue our efforts nationally in trade and development as advocated to some extent by the United Nations Conference for Trade and Development Despite our hopes, we have been disappointed to see that a number of international agreements essential for the settlement of the serious problem of underdevelopment have been obstructed because of the reluctance of some and because of other negative factors which have emerged in recent international meetings over the past few years  We optimistically hope that this standstill will be done away with as a result of the momentum provided by the United Nations   May I be allowed to conclude my statement by saying that I hope that this General Assembly session will live up to our expectations  At the same time I would invoke the words of the chairman of the delegation of China at the conclusion of the San Francisco Conference;The United Nations Conference on International Organization has concluded its vitally important mission of writing a Charter  This instrument will, I believe, prove itself to be an epochmaking document and will rank in its contribution to international justice and peace with the Magna Carta and the Constitution of the United States in their contribution to political liberty and representative government  It is an honour to participate once again in the General Assembly on behalf of the people of the Dominican Republic  I wish to begin my remarks with a special recognition of the work of SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon  We appreciate his dedication in the search for solutions to the conflicts that have shaken the world over the past years, and we wish him the best of luck in the new tasks that he will undertake The year is proving to be especially turbulent, with territorial conflicts and open identityrelated tensions in various parts of the world  We hope and insist, of course, that the international community will find a peaceful outcome to those conflicts — first and foremost for the sake of the millions of lives that are affected by them  Sometimes the urgency inherent in those tragedies weakens our commitment to address problems that appear to be less pressing but are the most important in the long term One such issue, with perhaps the largest scope and greatest potential for longterm transformation, is the fight against poverty and inequality  Over the past two decades, the rapid economic growth brought about by economic globalization has fuelled high expectations in the countries of the South  In fact, it was believed that the prosperity enjoyed by a few countries might finally be within everyone’s reach  It should be recognized that those hopes were not unfounded  Indeed, over the course of those two decades, hundreds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty But we cannot let ourselves be carried away by excessive optimism  We have an obligation to clarify the scope of those gains in the light of the actual data  We must also expand our horizons to observe those places and areas where globalization has not kept the promises made to humankind To begin with, we must remember that all of the hundreds of millions of people who were recently lifted out of poverty did not automatically become part of the middle class, nor did all who were able to do so necessarily remain there  We have, then, a new social segment, a segment that has already been lifted out of poverty, but whose position is much too fragile for us to consider it definitive  The word used to describe the situation of those men and women is “vulnerability” — vulnerability to unemployment, to the illness of a family member, to an economic crisis or a natural disaster, and vulnerability to a series of unforeseen events that could ruin their prospects for the future and return them to poverty in just a short time That vulnerable group now includes more than billion people around the world, who represent more than per cent of the world’s population, according to United Nations statistics  That population is especially large in Latin America and the Caribbean, where the majority of people earn between $and $a day  The challenge that we face is to strengthen the position of that emerging class  We must provide them with security and give them the tools and skills enabling them not only to develop their own lives, but also to participate in the development of their countries Let there be no doubt that new social class offers a great opportunity for our nations  Because of its expanded capacity for consumption and its ability to save, that social class has the potential to become, as has already been noted, an economic growth bonus, similar to the socalled demographic boom that our countries have seen as well  To bolster the emerging middle class will require more complex and better quality products in all sectors, from infrastructure to education  The path of that class to progress will enable our countries and the entire world to progress But in order to realize all of that potential, we must strengthen the safety nets and social supports in the areas of health, education, employment and social security, so as to keep vulnerable individuals from falling back into poverty  If we take that opportunity, not only can those men and women leave their difficulties behind forever, but they can also convert their countries into middle class, democratic and peaceful societies with less need to emigrate abroad  In other words, they can be the key to farreaching changes on our continent Within the framework of the Assembly, the postdevelopment agenda, the Agenda for Sustainable Development with its Sustainable Development Goals, provides a good road map for many of the challenges that we face in Latin America, the Caribbean and the world  Our country believes that it is important to work every day to reduce suffering and to develop strategies to ensure that the path out of poverty is a path of no return  However, in order to accomplish those goals, in order to lift people out of poverty — hundreds of millions of people — more is needed than merely adopting a series of formulas and indicators Profound changes must urgently be made to the methods by which trade and financial flows are carried out  That is to say, it is necessary to revise the rules of the game between rich countries and poor countries  We are talking about trade  We live in an age of unprecedented trade openness  My country, the Dominican Republic, like many others, has signed free trade agreements with the major economic blocs, which ought to be mutually beneficial — and in many cases they are  However, if I may say so in all honesty, there are times when the developed countries engage in hypocrisy  After more than half a century in which those countries were protected from everything that other countries were able to produce better, now those countries refuse to reduce protectionism within their borders, whereas under the free trade agreements they require that from their counterparts in developing countries  They want us, the developing countries, to eliminate our protections on industrial goods, but they do not eliminate agricultural subsidies For the next five years, for example, the United States will provide an average of $billion annually to support its agricultural sector, and in its multiyear subsidy policy for the period  the European Union will devote €billion to subsidize its agricultural sector  The agricultural protectionism practised by rich countries allows them to influence the market in their favour, while tariffs and trade barriers routinely exclude products from developing countries In addition, other nontariff barriers, such as phytosanitary regulations, are not transparent; they also create additional barriers to farmers in developing countries seeking to enter the global market  The developed countries have allowed those market distortions to persist and have continued to make rhetorical statements in favour of free trade  They should, rather, take concrete steps to attain the ideal of genuine free and fair trade Recently, countries such as ours that have signed on to free trade agreements have been forced to revise the terms of our existing agreements because of such protectionist practices that create situations of unequal competition  If the industrialized countries want to be true to their word, they must agree to significantly reduce their protectionism and their subsidies during current trade negotiations and, at the same time, ensure increased funding for rural development Just as we should seek greater fairness in trade, we must also ensure that financial flows serve as partners of development and productivity  For some time now, we have been living in an economy where the financial sector is becoming increasingly important  That is a reality that brings as many opportunities as dangers  We were all able to see, for example, how a purely financial crisis like the one that broke out in the  following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, was able to jeopardize years or decades of development efforts in many of our countries We have also had the opportunity to confirm how the free movement of capital can be used for the purposes of tax evasion or moneylaundering  The Dominican Republic, like many of the countries present in the Assembly today, can only benefit from more stable, predictable and better regulated financial markets  Therefore, this year, we have begun to adopt the antimoney laundering recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force of Latin America  Those measures include greater supervision of financial institutions, greater transparency of the legal status of persons, ensuring the legitimate ownership of assets, monitoring wire transfers, documenting retention policies, creating a framework for international cooperation and providing mutual legal assistance, among other measures, for making the Dominican banking system safer and more transparent It is worth noting that news such as the recent European Union ruling ordering the technology company Apple to pay €billion in unpaid taxes plainly demonstrates a reality that we have long known, namely, that tax havens do not necessarily exist only in sunny Caribbean countries  Quite the contrary, the great majority are under the jurisdiction of the richest countries  Moreover, contrary to the widespread idea that tax havens are merely places to conceal money, they are primarily platforms from which to conduct financial and trade operations in global capital markets  That is to say, it is not money stowed under the mattress but rather an integral part of the real economy that siphons resources from it and robs States of their prerogative of fiscal sovereignty The lack of regulation has paved the way for tax evaders and has made the work of tax authorities more complex  It constitutes a major threat to State funding worldwide, which undermines the ability of Governments to meet their enormous responsibilities to their citizens  We therefore applaud any initiatives that promote greater regulation of tax havens  We also know that the regulation of tax havens must be part and parcel of a larger system of effective public regulation and monitoring of financial markets, so that they can serve the real economy and its citizens It is our responsibility to continue to try to lift millions of people out of poverty, but we must do so by setting education, health, employment and socialsecurity policies that build on past successes and enable us to forge ahead  We will continue to be committed to the global exchange of goods and services, but let us ensure that those exchanges are fair and on a level playing field  We will open the floodgates of investment, thereby multiplying possibilities for production, research and growth, but let us also ensure fairness and transparency so that, in the medium and long term, our investment and growth will be in the service of the vast majority rather than a select few Let us build the necessary consensus to humanize the global economy  Let us bring the openness that we demand in finance to the regulation of migration flows  Let us use the same creativity and enthusiasm that we bring to launching lucrative businesses to finding solutions for those most in need  The millions of people who have recently emerged from poverty are the best proof that great things can be achieved when there is political will  Those millions of men and women are also our best partners and the primary reason to continue our work  We have made great strides, but there is a long road ahead of us  The steps ahead will require boldness and honesty  We must do away with taboos, rethink paradigms and redefine the rules of the game  Our country is committed to substantially reducing inequalities, but not only between the richest and poorest inhabitants of our countries, but also in reshaping the international relations between poor and rich countries Let us sit together for a dialogue based on mutual respect, equality and for the common good, without any privileges  Let us do so convinced that that is the only way that humankind can prevail  The time of zerosum games is over  It is time for all of us to add value  It is time to form alliances that seek to build and where all allies are equal  The international community can always count on the Dominican Republic to help along that path and to work in the service of the vast majority, who needs us  The delegation of theDominican Republic takes great pleasure in extending itswarmest congratulations to Mr  Samuel Insanally on hiswellmerited election to preside over the General Assemblyat this fortyeighth session  A man from our America  and,more specifically, from the Caribbean region, where both ofour countries are located  he has the required abilities andexperience successfully to guide our work at this session,which must confront and deal with the major challengesfacing the international community, namely, the achievementof peace and the economic and social development of ournations We also wish to express our appreciation to theoutgoing President, Mr  Stoyan Ganev, for the wisdom withwhich he led our deliberations at the previous session I should also like to take this opportunity to extend ourthanks to the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations,Mr  Boutros BoutrosGhali, for his commitment and for hisefforts to carry out the principles and purposes of theOrganization’s Charter Today, in our America, we are witnessing thebeginnings of a negotiated solution to conflict, and we arepleased that in Central America, and particularly in ElSalvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala, the disputes that havedisturbed the peace and hindered the development of ourpeoples are now being resolved at the negotiating table  Inour Island of Hispaniola, imperial and colonial rivalrydivided the population into two peoples who, over the courseof time, established two independent States  the DominicanRepublic, which we represent here, and the Republic ofHaiti  The efforts being made by the Haitian people andtheir leaders, with international assistance in the form ofnegotiations under the aegis of the United Nations and theOrganization of American States, are now beginning to bearfruit and will, we trust, restore normalcy to that fraternalcountry with the reestablishment of constitutional order In that connection our delegation reiterates its appeal tothe international community to lend real assistance tostabilize the democratic regime and to ensure the economicreconstruction of Haiti  assistance and cooperation adequateto meet the needs of peace and employment  TheDominican Republic, in so far as it is able, remains ready tocontinue to cooperate with this fraternal people to lighten theheavy burden of its current problems In this respect, we are pleased to report that the PrimeMinister of the Haitian Government, Mr  Robert Malval,recently made an official visit to the Dominican Republic,with a view to fully normalizing relations between theDominican and Haitian peoples and establishing the fullspectrum of relations between the two countries, in theirmutual interest  I am happy to say that the Haitian PrimeMinister was given a very warm welcome by the Presidentof the Dominican Republic, Mr  Joaquín Balaguer, who hasalways been interested in finding a solution to our brothercountry’s political conflict and especially in alleviating theserious economic situation there  As a result of the meeting,the two statesmen reached an agreement, subsequentlyformalized, that will ensure the speedy and constructivenormalization of relations, with real reciprocal cooperation,between our two States There is no more appropriate forum than this for me,on behalf of my country and Government, to appeal againfor massive aid from the most developed nations of theEarth to that afflicted and impoverished neighbouring brothercountry Since the conquest and colonization of America, theDominican Republic has defended human rights  It was inour island, Hispaniola, that a loud voice was first raised onbehalf of the rights of the indigenous inhabitants of ourAmerican lands  the voice of Brother Antón de Montesinos,in his famous Advent sermon  Faithful to that first call forthe redemption of our continent, our Government honoursthis historical tradition, which is fully valid today in ourcountry’s official and private practice  It has been workingon instruments  which might eventually becomeinternational in nature  that will contribute to givingjuridical force to that tradition General Assembly  Fortyeighth sessionOur country has advocated the universality of humanrights  We believe that neither geographical, economic,social, religious nor cultural differences can ever be used asa pretext for showing contempt for human rights The Dominican delegation believes that, because of theincrease in the membership of the United Nations  currentlyat countries  there should be a more equitablerepresentation in the Security Council, while at the sametime we continue to abide by the provisions of paragraph 1of Article of the United Nations Charter  Now that thebipolarity of the past has disappeared and the use and abuseof the veto are fading, the Council should become morerepresentative of the new international reality  This shouldbe done in broad consultations, after due reflection and withaccount taken of the need for equity, so that the Council canbecome more representative without its effectiveness beingin any way mitigated or weakened  Rather, its authority andresponsibility will be enhanced so that it can respondeffectively to any crisis with which the internationalcommunity might be confronted, as the Council has donerecently  In this regard, we consider that it would bepractical and feasible to give the Council greater flexibilityin meeting the just aspirations of nations, such as theRepublic of China, that wish to become Members of theUnited Nations and cooperate in carrying out its principles I would now like to express our views on developmentsin the international situation, particularly on conflicts that, inone way or another, have been affecting international peace I shall refer first to the Central American crisis, which,happily, today is on the road to a definitive solution becauseof the positive evolution, under the auspices of the UnitedNations, of the El Salvador peace agreements, and the recentreturn to democracy in Guatemala, which augurs well for theinstitutionalization of peace and prosperity in that region Next, we would like to refer to one of the mostcomplex and difficult conflicts facing the internationalcommunity today  that is, the existence of extremenationalism, which in some cases has led to fratricidal warsand the annihilation of large groups of people because ofracial and cultural hatred  This has happened in the formerYugoslavia, where even now, despite the efforts of theUnited Nations and intensive diplomatic activity, blood isstill being shed between brother peoples that until recentlylived together under one flag  Our Government wishes tosee a swift solution to the situation in the former Yugoslaviaand reiterates its support for measures taken by the SecurityCouncil, in particular the establishment of an internationalwar tribunal to pass judgement on crimes against humanitycommitted in some areas of the conflict We would especially like to point to one positivedevelopment that represents perhaps our best hope for peacetoday: the transitional agreement between the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and the Government of theState of Israel  The longstanding conflict in the MiddleEast engendered dangerous tension that has kept the entireworld in suspense and has been regarded as the potentialsource of a future conflagration of incalculabledestructiveness In connection with the development to which I havejust referred  the agreement between the Palestinians andthe State of Israel  it might be time to defer considerationof or remove the items on that conflict that have longappeared on the General Assembly’s agenda  With thisreciprocal exchange of olive branches of peace, we can seethe promise of harmony between peoples that have beenliving in such uneasy proximity We must recognize how the persistent diplomacy of theUnited States contributed to securing the results that havebeen achieved  The United States considered the situationwith a view to deciding what was possible in relationsbetween the Arab and Jewish peoples  The agreementculminated in the signing at the White House in Washington In our opinion, that demonstrated unequivocally and veryclearly to international public opinion the sincerity of theparties, who were fully aware of the extreme importance ofthe commitments into which they were entering We must constantly stress the importance of theenvironment  After economic crisis and the imbalancebetween North and South, the major challenge facingmankind is the environmental crisis  The gradual destructionof ecosystems and the deteriorating quality of life of humanbeings are unavoidable aspects of everyday existence for thepeoples of the world  Thus, it is essential that the course ofevents be changed  The political will of Governments andof all those who participate in organized civilian society willbe necessary to our taking up this great challenge, whichwill involve commitment on the part of everyone  acommitment from all mankind In that connection, the Dominican Republic supports thegeneral outline of the Plan of Action that was adopted at thesummit Conference on Environment and Development in Riode Janeiro in  Here we have a valuable instrument forpolitical programming and regional cooperation to protect theenvironment in Latin America and the Caribbean The latter part of the twentieth century has witnessedmajor changes in world political affairs, ranging from theend of the cold war to democratization in the countries ofFortyeighth session  October lEastern Europe Despite this ideological thaw, however, westill have arms trafficking and nuclear arsenals and,therefore, a serious threat to peace Let me refer once again to the situation in the Koreanpeninsula and mention specifically North Korea, which iscontinuing its nuclear research and investing enormousresources in this undertaking  Let us invite the Governmentof North Korea to become a party to the universalagreements on the control of nuclear weapons  Let us inviteit to cooperate transparently and effectively with theInternational Atomic Energy Agency in that body’simportant task of inspecting and monitoring nuclearfacilities  Willingness to do so would constitute evidence ofthat Government’s respect for its own nation and of itsconcern for the future of its people and of all mankind We support United Nations measures to put an end toarms trafficking  We support efforts to ensure transparencyin military expenditures so that military activity may bemade more predictable, and peace and international security,at the regional and world levels, strengthened Let me now turn to two important issues that are stillon the agenda of this Assembly May I, first, draw the attention of the internationalcommunity, as represented here, to the positivedevelopments in the area of drug trafficking, which are dueto the success of many measures aimed at combating anderadicating what has for too long been one of the mostominous scourges of mankind  None the less, we mustredouble our efforts to ensure that measures are implementedboth internally and internationally and result fromcoordinated policies of all the nations represented here today The Dominican Republic has just become a party to theUnited Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic inNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and the Protocol Amending the Single Convention on NarcoticDrugs of  bringing itself up to date on internationallegislation in order the better to play its role in collaboratingwith other States and agencies The other issue to which I wish to refer is the economiccrisis affecting most countries of the world  Today, thephenomenon of globalization of the economy and integrationof regional blocs is typical of the international situation,which is evolving so rapidly that countries such as mine canno longer put off negotiations to determine their participationin multilateral freetrade agreements, customs unions orregional markets In this connection, the international activities of theDominican Republic focus on the economic programmes ofcountries in our region and regional organizations that canhelp in our development and in our enjoyment of technicaland financial cooperation The implementation of appropriate domestic policies byour Government will ensure that trade and investment willbecome the ideal means to strengthen bilateral relations,underpinned, of course, by the unilateral granting of tradebenefits under the Caribbean Basin Initiative and by theopening up of our market under the Americas Initiative In the new international order, another of the majorchallenges that the Dominican Republic must face is theNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and itspossible implications; we understand that NAFTA, as atheoretical possible outcome, would imply an effort towardsthe complete liberalization of trade throughout thehemisphere I should like to emphasize the Dominican Republic’sstrong support for holding a World Summit for SocialDevelopment to take up matters relating to the socialsituation in the world, particularly that of women, youngpeople, the elderly, the handicapped and families  TheSummit will have to deliver a clear undertaking for commonpolicies to defend and protect these important segments ofthe world’s population collectively, and we hope that manyof our countries will take measures to extend coverage andprotection for these social sectors, especially for children andthe elderly We should like to draw to members’ attention a subjectof serious concern to my Government and country, and thathas complex and serious ramifications that will be broughtbefore the appropriate forums during the fortyeighthGeneral Assembly session  This is the SecretaryGeneral’sproposal to merge the International Research and TrainingInstitute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) withthe United Nations Development Fund for Women(UNIFEM)  Theoretically, the General Assembly will studythis proposal in November My Government attaches the greatest importance to thisdecision, and requests this world forum to give it its closestattention in order to avoid committing a grave injustice bytaking hasty action or the like INSTRAW was conceived at the First WorldConference on Women, held in Mexico City in  andwas established as the result of a series of resolutions,including, we should like to recall, Economic and SocialGeneral Assembly  Fortyeighth sessionCouncil resolution of May  This resolutionspecified clearly that the permanent headquarters of theInstitute was to be my country, the Dominican Republic, adeveloping country Moreover, my Government gave the United Nations thebuilding that is being used as the Institute’s headquarters Not only that, it had to make significant investments interms of money and other resources in order to overhaul thebuilding to bring it up to the specifications required by theOrganization We request the SecretaryGeneral to postpone anyaction leading to merger between INSTRAW and UNIFEMuntil such time as the General Assembly considers hisproposal and comes to its own conclusions on the matter Also, it would seem that there is an attempt being madeto ignore, unilaterally, the Agreement between the UnitedNations and the host Government that is the legal frameworkwithin which INSTRAW operates  My Government regardsthis as a serious  an extremely serious  impropriety, andreserves the right to use all relevant legal means to assert itslegitimate rights Finally, the delegation I lead calls upon the consciencesof all nations and on all those leaders who bear upon theirshoulders responsibility for the destiny of their countries andthe world, for peace, common sense and mutual respect toprevail over violence and for there to be cooperation andsolidarity between peoples; for these are the supremepurposes of this Organization  On behalf of the Government and the people of the Dominican Republic, it is a pleasure to extend our warmest congratulations to Mr  Srgjan Kerim of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia upon his recent election as President of the General Assembly  We would also like to take this opportunity to greet the members of the General Assembly   During the four years following the Millennium Summit of  the Dominican Republic went through a crisis, during which our national currency was devalued by per cent  Our working class had to double its efforts simply to meet their basic subsistence needs  Drug trafficking and high levels of crime gained a foothold, and our credibility went down worldwide  According to the statistics of the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, more than million out of the million Dominicans sank into the lowest levels of poverty  At that time, we were facing one of the most dramatic crises in the modern history of the Dominican Republic   Since we took the reins of administration in  the Dominican Republic has managed to recover the confidence of investors and entrepreneurs  We have been able to reactivate economic growth  We have been able to reduce inflation  We have increased jobs and improved social conditions and quality of life for the Dominican people   However, exactly when we began, just like the phoenix rising from its own ashes, a gloomy international picture threatened to darken our prospects for future growth  In recent weeks, for example, the price of oil on the international market has reached an unprecedented rate, and projections point towards continued increases  These price increases are asphyxiating our economies   Similarly, in recent times, as a result of changes on the international stage, free zone companies in the Dominican Republic, alongside those in Mexico and Central America, have been losing their competitive edge to Asian countries  This drop in competitiveness has resulted in the loss of jobs, production stagnation and a shortage of new investment   Moreover, while the price of oil is rising, and with the prices of goods in the global economy fluctuating, we also find ourselves unexpectedly affected by price increases for food  All of a sudden we are surprised by the news that owing to the elimination of export subsidies in Europe, the price of milk has increased on the international market  The same has occurred, although for different reasons, with the cost of corn, soybeans and wheat as well as with other products that comprise the basic nutrition of the family  Because of the climbing prices of those products, the cost of chicken, turkey, bread and eggs have also risen   As will be appreciated, we are facing a dangerous situation which could lead our people towards widespread famine and, consequently, a plunge into extreme poverty  Those factors have led to a vicious cycle that is spreading throughout the global food chain, while, in spite of the plea for free trade, producers in the world’s most powerful countries remain protected  As an example, while a United States  farmer has access to stateoftheart farming equipment, the most modern facilities and technologically proficient staff, that farmer also receives government subsidies of approximately US $per year  Furthermore, the farmer might produce a pound of corn for a mere cents   At the same time, Félix David García Peña, also a corn farmer, who belongs to the Association of Farmers in San Juan de la Maguana in the southern part of the Dominican Republic near our border with Haiti, is struggling alone to make ends meet and to lead a decent life  His farming equipment is outdated  His tractor emits clouds of smoke every morning when he attempts to turn it on  His facilities are dilapidated  He receives no government subsidies since the Government is in no financial position to help him, and his production cost for one pound of corn is cents, almost double the production cost of the subsidized United States farmer  When we asked Felix how we, as the Government, could help him, he stated, “I don’t want anything  All I want is fair trade to be able to sell my corn  The fact is that the challenges of globalization are having a marked impact on countries like the Dominican Republic  What we are experiencing is the interdependent character of current international trends  What seems to be a distant or remote event nevertheless has a direct impact on the daily lives of our peoples   Another example that illustrates the undeniable interdependence of all nations on earth is climate change  That topic is not new to our discussions in this Organization, but with each year that passes we find ourselves closer to the predicted disasters   In the Dominican Republic, we are already experiencing the impact of climate change in various ways: an increase in the volatility and frequency of floods, droughts and hurricanes that destroy our ecosystem, our biodiversity and our infrastructures  Also, we are experiencing increased coastal erosion and loss of beaches as well as frequent bleaching of our coral reefs, thus reducing our marine biodiversity and making tourism less attractive   Given all those challenges presented by globalization, a country like the Dominican Republic asks itself: where is international solidarity, where is cooperation between peoples, how are we going to address together all of those challenges which affect most of the peoples of the world   The truth is that there cannot be solidarity when there are those in the world who seek to accumulate wealth even while others suffer  There cannot be cooperation when there are people who think only of conducting business without taking into account the pain and anguish of others   The United Nations system was created to promote solidarity and cooperation, and it is only fair to recognize that there is no other organization at the world level that has the prestige, capability and vocation of the Members of this world Organization  However, this grand forum of humanity, established after the enormous sacrifices of the Second World War, must also reform itself, if it intends to fulfil the ideals that inspired its creation, as enshrined in the Charter at the San Francisco Conference   The current structure of the United Nations is no longer adequate today  The structure still corresponds to the coldwar period, even though humankind has advanced beyond an era when all events of importance were determined by the rivalry of two superPowers   Now, in the twentyfirst century, we in the Dominican Republic do not truly comprehend why the President of the World Bank must be an American and the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, a European and why major global decisions are the responsibility of only five countries   As one of the founding Members of the United Nations, the Dominican Republic aspires to a position on the United Nations Security Council as a nonpermanent member  In that position, we would strive to be a voice in favour of the weak, those without protection or shelter, the forsaken of the world  That is our sole aspiration  The Dominican Republic will uphold, responsibly and with conviction and determination, the values and principles the Organization has pledged to represent, as a beacon for peace, human dignity and the civilized coexistence of all inhabitants of the Earth   If we review the activities of the United Nations since the days of San Francisco, we realize that never before has mankind been so deeply concerned with the question of peace, this peace which we have not yet been able to achieve despite all our efforts and despite the material we have collected and examined in the hope of offering this great achievement to future generations  The fact is that the human and natural elements in our difficult task of reconciling various aspirations, ideals and interests are so prominent that we are at times dramatically made aware of our shortcomings, of obvious areas of disagreement and of lack of comprehension How, then, can we achieve peace  That is the main concern of the delegation representing the Dominican Republic at this eleventh session of the General Assembly, which is attended by the largest number of Member States in its history — the old founder States, like our own, those which joined later, and the new Members which are to offer us their muchneeded cooperation, inasmuch as we agree that the universality of the United Nations, one of our longstanding hopes, is one of the main objectives of the Charter Yet the task of achieving peace has its price and is beset with thorny problems  The price must be paid in respect of any human endeavour and the thorny problems will arise because no path is ever entirely smooth  The peace that we all long for and that would fulfil the yearning of millions of human beings throughout the world has implications and a meaning of considerable importance for the world today; it could be achieved through joint and sincere efforts if each, one of us were to act in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and develop his capabilities and if nations, like men, and States, like individuals, attained such a degree of social equilibrium and tolerance that they could discharge their domestic obligations without neglecting their foreign obligations and meet their international responsibilities without projecting their domestic policies into the outside world  What I have described is, in short, the good neighbour policy, which has already been proclaimed in the American continent — that admirable solidarity in efforts to promote the common good and the respect for human dignity and for the principles governing modern society and the international community Can it be that, instead of promoting peace, the material advancement of peoples corrupts peace, undermines and saps its very foundations  When we examine the achievements of our century and realize the existence of tremendous forces equally capable of mass destruction and of creation, all we can do is utter our desire for peace, a desire surely cherished in all the States which are aware of the responsibilities that would have to be borne in the event of another world war We are living in crucial times  The emergency meetings of the United Nations, precipitated by the events in the Middle East and Hungary, show how, through the United Nations, solutions can be worked out that are preferable to dramatic and irretrievably extreme action  The Charter itself mentions international cooperation and refers to the standards of conduct and ethics by which normal relations between countries should at all times be governed The Dominican delegation appears before the Assembly sharing the concern felt by all, because we can neither ignore the interdependence of nations and the universality of the international community, nor believe that a conflict of international proportions would fail to affect us  For this reason, people no longer think in terms of isolationism or neutralism, except as a means of concealing other designs, but on the contrary try to explain their position and policy in such a way that everyone knows with whom he is dealing All this has brought us to the conclusion that today, and in view of the way in which problems were dealt with during the emergency sessions, we are faced with a choice: on the one hand there is extremism, barbarity, the cruel treatment of defenceless masses calling for their freedom and rights, the enslavement of peoples whose name will always live in history and the enslavement of civilized nations with outstanding traditions, jealous of their patrimony and skill; on the other hand, there are the aspirations to a sensible form of selfdetermination, free of extremism and realizable by peaceful and normal means, democracy and all that it implies, the determination to conduct foreign policy according to the principles of the United Nations Charter and to contribute to world order by measures unaccompanied by schemes of political and ideological domination For these reasons, we wholeheartedly supported the desire of the Hungarian people for freedom, a desire which has already been expressed by the Dominican people, its Congress, its Government and its social groups; for these reasons we also sympathized with the process of democratization in Poland, beheld with revulsion the repressive measures taken as a result of events in Poznan and were shocked by the grim tragedy of Budapest, that city flowing with blood and destroyed by the tanks of the army dispatched from the sinister walls of the Kremlin by the machinery of communism, which in our day has enacted the crudest scenes of contemporary history General Hector Bienvenido Trujillo, the President of the Dominican Republic, recently sent the following message to the President of the Assembly of Captive European Nations: “I have the honour to refer to your message in which you, as the President of the Assembly of Captive European Nations, request the cooperation of the Dominican Government in the adoption of measures which will put an end to Soviet aggression in Hungary and give effect to the provisions of the General Assembly resolution of November [(ESII)]  “I hasten to inform you and the other members of the Assembly of Captive European Nations that the Dominican Republic condemns wholeheartedly the violation of the United Nations Charter by the Soviet Union and will support unreservedly any action the object of which is to restore the sovereignty of the Hungarian people and to ensure respect for its inherent rights as one of the communities having the finest democratic traditions in the history of Christian civilization  “The Dominican representatives to the United Nations have received instructions to support the suggestions made by the Assembly of Captive European Nations and to join in any move toward restoring to the Hungarian people its right to selfdetermination and implementing effectively the principles of the United Nations Charter, so grossly violated by the aggressive forces which are endeavouring to enslave man and to destroy the foundations of international order and human coexistence  “In accordance with the policy adopted by Generalissimo Trujillo after the meeting of envoys, the doors of our country remain open to all Hungarian citizens and to any persons from other countries subjected to Communist barbarity; in our country they will always have an opportunity of working in full freedom and of cooperating with my Government in its efforts both to strengthen the country and to promote world peace, and to preserve and defend the institutions and principles which constitute the culture of the Western peoples That is why we pay our respectful tribute to the Hungarian heroes of the resistance, whose undying memory will live in the hearts of all who love freedom, and we take this opportunity to state that the Government of the Dominican Republic has decided, and has already informed the competent departments of the United Nations Secretariat, that it is prepared to welcome thousands of Hungarian refugees in a genuine desire to alleviate the situation in which they find themselves at this time at the frontiers of their subjugated country We submit that it would be intolerable if communism, by direct intervention with forces of the Soviet Union, were to impose on the Hungarians a Government which they do not want, particularly after they had indicated their intention of shaping the policy of their country along lines more in keeping with universal democracy  It is on that ground that the great majority of the General Assembly based itself in expressing disapproval of the Soviet intrusion in Hungary, for this is far from being a domestic question of the Hungarian State or one of those political changes which are so common in many countries  The difference defies analysis, and there is no point in dwelling on it The world today rejects ideological interventionism by communism; a fortiori, it rejects communism supported by force  Therefore, the United Nations seeks to convey, by an expression of majority opinion, the idea that there are many other ways of making a country the ally of another, of making normal relations fruitful ; instead of contributing to the formation of centres of dissension, one should, on the contrary, work to the utmost for coexistence protected by peace and the principles of international equality and cooperation For us the United Nations has been and will continue to be the only possible forum for the joint consideration of the problems of our generation  That is why we are so happy that at the present session nineteen additional Member States have been seated which, with the few that are still outside our ranks — among them Japan — constitute the long dreamed of, almost utopian, expression of that perfect association, which has been moulded by the needs of our civilization  We congratulate them Among the States recently admitted there are some, however, which cannot but receive our special congratulations  They are Spain and Italy: Spain, the protagonist of the great epic of America, whose blood, language, religion and traditions we proudly carry in our hearts and for which the Dominican Republic, as its firstborn, feels so much affection; and Italy, the source of our Latin heritage, whose friendship for us, and that of its people, its children, have been so constant The agenda of the eleventh session includes delicate, difficult items with important political angles, and other items which help to justify to public opinion the existence of the United Nations  We have always believed that the United Nations should not be judged by its behaviour in dealing with or solving international problems which, because they affect the supreme political interests of Member States, sometimes are, by their nature, not amenable to immediate action on the part of this association of nations  Many people see only the vetoes in the Security Council, and think that the resolutions are not binding or that there is no way of enforcing them, that the machinery of the United Nations is no better than that of the old League of Nations because it has not been able to restrain the recklessness and ambitions of some States Nothing could be further from the truth than that kind of thinking  The United Nations, by the very nature and temperament of the Charter, is a uniform whole whose objectives are clearly set out in the Preamble  In the social, economic and legal spheres, in research into the indices of our civilization, in the work of many agencies, in the interchange of data and of comparative statistics, it has achieved considerable, even unhoped for, progress  What we should like to emphasize, most of all, is the personal interchange which enables men of all countries and races, origins, creeds and religions to know virtues and faults, things which cannot be measured but which, in the long run, enable us to evaluate problems and help to guide Governments and peoples For example, there is the progress achieved in technical assistance, on which the hopes of many underdeveloped communities rest; if we look at the records of other specialized agencies, we find in all their plans, in their results, experiments, studies, failures and successes, a solid conviction of success in obtaining what is best and in constantly doing something more for the welfare of the world and its inhabitants Finally, let us look at Chapters XI and XII of the Charter: they govern the treatment of dependent territories and entitle us to raise banners of triumph, for under the Charter new States have been created, selfgovernment has been granted or foreshadowed, and, finally, within a few years, in  we shall witness the attainment of independence by Somaliland and of selfgovernment by Western Samoa, Territories which have been influenced by the Charter and which, through the collaboration of their peoples and administrators, have succeeded in mapping out their future political destiny After all, the United Nations is but the work of men and we have to expect to suffer from human weaknesses  It is for all of us to strengthen the United Nations and not to abandon it to the mercies of unrestrained emotions, the shocks of Marxist ideologies, or excessive nationalism, devoid of understanding and realism  The exercise of authority under the law and of respect for the inherent rights of man will help to make more tangible all that is proclaimed by “the supreme law of the international community” This session of the General Assembly is dominated by the grave problems of the Middle East and Hungary, and it is not too much to say that there is a tendency towards much greater aggravation of certain difficulties in areas with reference to which the United Nations has included items on its agenda at the request of some of its Member States  Let us hope that, with a real understanding of the more urgent matters, those genuinely deserving priority, we shall be able to consider them with clarity of judgement, and that those others which tend to arouse or accentuate differences will be dealt with in a truly calm spirit  That, at any rate, is the consideration which will guide the delegation of the Dominican Republic in the consideration of the items on the agenda In connexion with the present conflict in the Middle East, we should like to stress that, now that the General Assembly has made the necessary recommendations for its settlement in the spirit of the Charter and now that a ceasefire has been attained in that region, all our efforts and all our energies should be combined to put a speedy end to that situation; it should certainly not be exploited for the purpose of introducing new elements of discord which might precipitate a conflict of greater proportions My country wishes to express its thanks to the whole General Assembly for bestowing upon it the honour of selecting its representative as Chairman of the Fourth Committee; it is but a recognition of the constant attention we have given to such problems both during the sessions of the General Assembly and during the four years in which the Dominican Republic has served on the Trusteeship Council  The delegation of the Dominican Republic is confident that it will do justice to this proof of esteem, which comes primarily from the LatinAmerican group, now more than ever united on important United Nations problems I should also like to say that our membership for another year in the Economic and Social Council has enabled us to maintain our working association with the other States represented on that important body  In the Economic and Social Council, the Dominican Republic has been faithful to its ideas of social development, and of the existence of an inalienable right to social advancement, and to a reasonable policy of understanding for the various economic problems of the world Since our country is developing its own natural resources; since social law in the Dominican Republic is being promoted under the immediate direction of the leader who is our guide and inspiration; since advanced social and labour legislation has been adopted; and since our country is supported by a solid and stable economy, which is reflected in the excellent state of its finances, we naturally welcome the guidance given by the Economic and Social Council and, in spite of the magnitude of its schemes, devote ourselves to the great work it is doing for the benefit of mankind In keeping with these ideas, we assure the General Assembly that the delegation of the Dominican  Republic is prepared to serve with enthusiasm the cause of peace, that our position will always be inspired by that ideal, and that, whenever the whole world looks to the United Nations for something tangible from its deliberations, we shall approach the intricate aspects of the maintenance and development of international orderliness with more hope than pessimism and with more conviction than despair The Government of the Dominican Republic hopes for peace, for a lasting peace, with guarantees, with respect for every State, with relations based on a worthy concept of coexistence  Finally, it hopes that the United Nations, in this hour of uncertainty, will be guided by the supreme demands of justice and right and will find the roads that lead to the happiness of all mankind for which we yearn  His Excellency Mr  Antonio GuterresSecretary General of the United NationsHis Excellency Volkan BozkirPresident of the h General Assembly of the United NationsYour Excellencies Heads of State and GovernmentsYour Excellencies Ministers of Foreign AffairsHonorable Heads of DelegationCitizens of the world When the representatives of nations, including mine, signed the Charter of the United Nations in San Francisco on June  the world was still in flames The horrors unleashed by the Second World War were still atrocious realities against which the international community conspired so they would never happen again  As a result of that commitment to peace and dialogue among peoples, this Organization was born in whose General Assembly I am honored to participate today for the first time on behalf of the Dominican people, and in whose name I congratulate the United Nations on its h Anniversary The world of is evidently different from that of and I am confident to proclaim that it is also better  And it is so, to a large extent, thanks to the United Nations effort during these three quarters of a century to maintain international peace and security, encourage cooperation between peoples to solve global problems and serve, ultimately, as meeting point for the nations that share this planet Without the UN the Universal Declaration of Human Rights would not exist, something inconceivable for us today; neither would we have organizations like UNICEF, FAO, the World Health Organization, the World Bank or international criminal courts  Nor would have been carried out the peacekeeping missions that, through its history, have avoided so much suffering The world of is better than in but far from perfect  New challenges and threats bring global problems whose scale requires joint solutions that can only be solved through loyal cooperation among the nations represented in this Assembly years ago, the international community had to take on the colossal challenge posed by reconstruction after the ravages of war, which in turn brought about additional obstacles that required commitment, imagination and work to overcome However, it would be reckless to deceive ourselves  History is not linear; at every crossroads there is always the risk of setbacks that hinder goals achieved towards development, progress and peace, which are always so hard to reach Therefore, as leaders and servants of our respective nations, we must know there is zero margin of error if we intend to face the challenges of our time in our own way and alone If in the years of the UN’s existence, multilateralism and international cooperation have been valuable tools, now they are essential and it is imperative that everyone do their part That this meeting of the General Assembly has to be held by videoconference is already the perfect example of the main problem we, as leaders and servants of our respective peoples, must face  Covidhas put the entire planet in check joining threats such as climate change, which affects us all, but it is highly serious in island countries like the Dominican Republic  I am not exaggerating if I say that both dangers could bring other conflicts into the equation; which will, as usual, viciously prey upon the most vulnerable As a nonpermanent member of the Security Council, the Dominican Republic has made a special contribution to the agenda of the Protection of Civilians in Conflict in the Context of Covidthrough a Presidential Declaration that had the unanimous agreement of the Council  That is the spirit that should prevail in the immediate future when it comes to carrying out the policies allowing us to stop the pandemic first, extend treatment and vaccination later, and in the meantime, rebuilding what the pandemic has damaged In the Dominican Republic, the pandemic has hit us particularly hard because we have had a precarious social protection system, with per capita social spending of $compared to the regional average of $ While the paradox exists that we are one of the nations with the highest economic growth in the region, it has not managed, so far, to close the equity gap We all here know, the equity gap will only be fixed by investing in Health and Education  This is why my Government is launching the most ambitious public health program in our history to achieve universal coverage by the end of the year as we increase public investment in the National Health System Along with this, there is a plan to promote quality Education that, among other measures, will provide students and teachers with electronic devices so that Coviddoes not disturb at all their educational process  The future does not wait, and our students cannot miss a minute of their learning And this is why our young people are one of our top priorities; we will work to ensure they get the best education  In this sense, I believe there is no better education than a comprehensive one that encourages students’ participation in all areas affecting them  Proof of this is the acceptance of the DominicanFrench initiative to promote resolution ( — adopted unanimously by the Security Council in July — to strengthen the member states’ commitment to the global agenda of youth, peace and security and that directly involves young people in these plans However, talking about peace and security without talking about development is, simply and plainly, wasting time  Before the pandemic this Organization was already in a reform process to assist Member States in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of the Agenda It is evident that achieving these objectives requires an “accelerated implementation” with the purposeful commitment of the developed countries However, five years after the adoption of the Agenda, the majority of developing countries are lagging behind, and those middleincome nations  such as the Dominican Republic— face particular challenges, because although their economies are advancing institutional weaknesses prevail that lead to inequality  It is therefore essential to modify that Agenda so it responds to the reality and problems facing each country The Dominican Republic will spare no effort with the Agenda, because for years our country has been implementing a National Development Strategy that shares objectives with the United Nations Agenda  Yet, I recognize, to achieve full compliance in just ten years is a challenge requiring the collaboration of all civil society, with publicprivate collaboration with a national vision, and keeping in mind the essential assistance needed by lagging countries years ago, this organization was born with the purpose of banishing forever from the international community’s vocabulary the “we” versus “you” or “them” to assume the “everyone”  And this is what Covidintends to put to the test  But I predict it will fail if this Assembly assumes the threat will be annulled through policies not combining the legitimate national interests of each country with the global solutions adopted by the entire international community  To do this, we must act in three areas: Health, Education and Technology In the field of Health, this meeting should help create the conditions of universal access to the vaccine against Covidas soon as the remedy is available  From here, WE DEMAND that the vaccine be accessible to all human beings on the planet  The reason for the creation of an organization like this is to measure up to historical challenges such as this one  To achieve this, the role of the World Health Organization is essential, as well as the creation of a global solidarity fund that will serve as a reserve to mitigate the ravages of future pandemics In the field of schooling, we must share the most positive experiences, including online education, skills training and support investment efforts in educational policies Finally, the UN must be the engine and guide so that the t century is truly the century of knowledge thanks to ever advancing communication technologies  Hence, ending the digital divide is one of the urgent priorities for the international community However, all development and all progress will be useless if the values enshrined by this Organization in its Universal Declaration of Human Rights are not taken into account  The UN knows that it has the solid commitment of the Dominican Republic to defend these values; to advance towards higher levels of human dignity that promote policies to guarantee equality between men and women, as well as protect children affected by armed conflicts, or at risk of being sold as slaves, prostituted or used for pornography  Appalling realities happening on our planet today, that we have a moral mandate to eradicate once and for all Ladies and Gentlemen:I bring to this meeting the mandate of the Dominican people to proclaim our nation’s commitment to protecting the environment and to continue supporting the Paris Agreements Furthermore, I believe the time has come to enhance its postulates  In the Security Council, we have advocated that security factors within the Climate Change context be more broadly and indepth studied, because a natural phenomenon can cause or aggravate any conflict, mainly in highly fragile areas The occurrence of natural phenomena and extreme climatic events are becoming more frequent and their greater intensity particularly affects the small island developing states  Which forces this Organization to continue on the path of not considering such phenomena as isolated eventualities, but as common and recurrent realities for which we must be ready The list of threats and complications can scare anyone  However, this organization has demonstrated over threequarters of a century that, through dialogue and cooperation, any goal can be achieved, no matter how remote it may seem Whoever thinks one can change the world by one’s self is wrong, and whoever does not know how to measure one’s strength to adjust our contribution will also be wrong  Therefore, on behalf of Dominican men and women, I share our deep commitment, purpose and work to provide solutions to the best of our ability  Close to eleven million Dominicans are eager to do their part The Dominican Republic was in the founding hour of this Organization and, since then, has demonstrated its will and commitment in the concert of nations for the sake of peace, prosperity, equity and global diversity  We are aware of our demographic and economic reality, but our condition will never be an excuse for not contributing the best of ourselves as we have tried to do for years The UN, as I understand it, is not concerned with diplomacy, but with the future and, as Eleanor Roosevelt said on the day of the solemn proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, “the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of your dreams ” Let us therefore attain a world in peace, diverse, prosperous and sustainable for at least more years Thank you very much  \\ufeffI should like my words to this Assembly, to which are brought such important problems and thorny situations, to be a fervent message of the faith and hope of the Dominican Government, a message brought from the heart of the land where the first institutions were established after the discovery of America and the meeting of races and cultures On behalf of the Dominican Republic, I wish most sincerely to congratulateMr  Guido de Marco on his having been elected President of the fortyfifth session of the General Assembly  In conferring on him such an outstanding honour, the Organisation has recognised his outstanding diplomatic work and his devotion to the cause of peace He also wish to congratulate the President of the fortyfourth session, the Ambassador of Nigeria, Major General Joseph Garba, on the excellent work he did and on the wisdom and discretion with which he overcame innumerable obstacles We reiterate our gratitude to the SecretaryGeneral, Mr  Javier Peres de Cuellar, who has spared no efforts in the cause of world peace  He has even made several trips to that region of anguish the Middle East, and has established valuable personal contacts with the aim of finding a negotiated solution to the crisis that affects that region, in particular the Persian Gulf We wish to place on record the great pleasure of the Dominican Republic at the admission of Namibia to the Organisation  That country should have taken its seat here long ago, but finally its admission has become a reality It is with great pleasure that we associate ourselves with the expressions of solidarity made here following the admission of the State of Liechtenstein  It has been welcomed with much pleasure as a member of this family of nations, which has thus come nearer to universality  At this crucial moment in contemporary history it is an imperative need for the Organisation to carry out its sacred mission of safeguarding peace at all costs  Scarcely five years ago tensions between the nuclear Powers were growing more acute, and the arms race had accelerated greatly and represented a terrible danger to human existence  The talks and the agreements on the elimination of short and mediumrange missiles prove that with political will peace can be maintained The unexpected and brutal invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, which overthrew its legitimate Government and violated the sovereignty of a virtually helpless nation, has been condemned by the whole international community  Such is the enormity of this violation perpetrated at all levels by the reckless Iraqi leader, on whom all eyes are fixed in horror, that we cannot foresee the future course of these events The SecretaryGeneral, Mr  Javier Peres de Cuellar, in his introductory statement to the fortyfifth session, indicated his concern over the crisis in the Persian Gulf and the resultant danger of a vast conflagration  The Dominican Republic, as an active member of the community of nations, fully supports the terms and substance of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council in view of this grave violation, this armed attack that has usurped the sovereignty of a State, and invokes the inherent right of selfdefence as the necessary response of the international community in the face of this gross and unprecedented annexation Turning now to my country, the President of the Republic, Dr  Joaquin Balaguer, after being reelected in May and assuming office in midAugust this year, has been striving to carry out the arduous task of the modernisation of our State at all levels, executing a plan of economic adjustment and national consultation among labour, management and the general public, which should end with the establishment of our economy on a sound basis  Nevertheless, our country, like other developing countries, is facing the serious problem of external debt, aggravated by the persistently low prices of our export commodities  The debt is a heavy burden that hinders our growth and development  Reforms of economic policy and structural adjustment that we have carried out cannot be fully effective unless the developed countries adopt measures to alleviate this insupportable burden of debt  In this regard we greatly welcome the initiative of President Bush to grant partial forgiveness of the concessional debt and we urge creditor countries to implement similar programmes to reduce or cancel debt through official assistance, since now that the debt has become unpayable it has turned into a problem that can only be dealt with through international cooperation I should indicate that the Read of the Dominican State has achieved the best results in his policy of providing the country with the infrastructure it requires for its growth and subsequent development  Here we should mention the construction of housing, hospitals, sports facilities, schools, local road networks, aqueducts and dams  His Government enjoys general recognition and gratitude for the striking results of the creation of new free trade zones in different areas of our country  Re is also credited with being the real initiator and main driving force of tourism and the growing development of the tourist infrastructure of our country This vast work of national renewal has been made possible thanks to the climate of democracy, confidence and security prevailing in our country and thanks to the absolute respect of the Government for the free exercise of human rights, from the main human right, the right to life, to unrestricted freedom of expression and thought  In this way the noble principles enshrined in the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Hunan Rights and in international covenants on the subject are being translated into reality  Any foreigner coating to the Dominican Republic can see the reality of a proverbially hospitable nation that enjoys peace, quiet and order under the total protection of its competent authorities We have always been opposed to any form of racial discrimination because such discrimination constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights  So it is a subject of justified pleasure to see how the South African President,Frederik De Klerk, is becoming reconciled to this view and how he has admitted to the press the possibility of candidates of any race having the right to vote  That presages the beginning of the process that will finally lead to the elimination of the hated system of apartheid  Any act of discrimination regardless of its form and regardless of the person or entity it is directed against, is to be censured and is contrary to morality and law  In the light of this reflection, the delegation of the Dominican Republic believes that the resolution which equated Zionism with racism is in and of itself an act of discrimination, and thus we feel that it should be repealed The unification of the Korean peninsula is a subject of the greatest concern to the international community  The Dominican Republic expresses its pleasure at the advances made by the communities of South Korea and North Korea in the areas of economic cooperation and cultural exchange as part of the process of rapprochement, which, on the basis of dialogue and negotiation between the two sides, could lead to the reunification of Korea  Accordingly, until the achievement of that unity, we would favour the admission of South Korea to the United Nations The reunification of Germany, an event of such extraordinary importance that it does not need to be emphasised here, constitutes a veritable milestone in the history of the United Nations  It represents the most outstanding case of integration and national reconciliation in the postwar period  It shows how much can be accomplished by fraternity and solidarity, and it is the most striking example of integration in this new era of changes and opportunities that can lead to a better future for mankind Aware of the extremely serious problem of drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking, the Dominican Government is implementing severe measures to combat that scourge which so cruelly afflicts mankind  Our authorities are waging active campaigns for the prevention of drug abuse, while taking vigorous administrative, judicial and legislative action against the production, use and marketing of and illicit trafficking in drugs I feel it is appropriate here to turn to a subject that is of great interest today the process of transition to a democratic pattern that has been going on for some time now in the Republic of Haiti  On this subject the Dominican delegation expresses its satisfaction at the encouraging progress made in the preparations for the holding of presidential elections that will soon take place in that country  The Dominican Republic therefore favours the provision of assistance by the United Nations in the form of observers appointed by our Organisation to assist the Haitian nation during the elections By an accident of fate the Republic of Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the same island and have known similar vicissitudes on their respective paths towards independence and sovereignty, and therefore we are most interested in seeing our sister nation achieve stability  But our country fundamental interest is not limited to that aspect; it also concerns Haiti political and economic development Haiti needs the support of the entire international community, since until we, the nations of this hemisphere, have thus far confined ourselves to pointing out the problems without striving to find the right solutions to them, for that reason, we feel it is time to discuss, this delicate situation before the Assembly  Its scope is more than national, even than regional, and it has become a question that deserves the attention of the international community The Dominican Republic, familiar with the problems of our neighbour country and aware of its own historic responsibilities, has found it necessary to receive a constant flow of Haitian immigrants, numbering more than million, who are competing freely with the Dominican labour force  Our country accepted this immigration since one of the cardinal principles of its foreign policy is to regard solidarity as the highest elevated expression of human conscience  Thus Haitian nationals also enjoy the same benefits and prerogatives and Dominicans, in an atmosphere of security and respect without discrimination of any kind Lastly, we are particularly pleased to state that as the obstacles to the full rehabilitation of Haiti are gradually overcome, opportunities for greater cooperation between our two countries will increase and we shall march together towards the achievements of our most cherished ideals and our highest national aspirations In conclusion, I should like to stress our conviction that the United Nations is the authentic custodian that will preserve the inestimable treasure of the lofty values extolled at the dawn of a new era of harmony and peace  This bright awakening of the universal conscience reflects the emergence of an era based on the high principles enshrined in the Charter of this noble institution, the nurturing source of all the hopes and desires of Mankind  It is a great honour for me today toaddress the General Assembly at its fiftyninth session,on behalf of the Government of Leonel Fernández andof the people of the Dominican Republic, in this forumdevoted to the maintenance of peace and the promotionof development and harmony among peoples  Onceagain, we are speaking out on the most delicate andimportant issues on the international agenda so that wecan join forces in the search for viable solutions to theproblems that affect us all I extend my sincerest congratulations to you, Sir,on your election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fiftyninth session  We are confidentthat you will steer our work along the path of peaceand security for the good of mankind  We alsounderscore the important work accomplished by theoutgoing President, Mr  Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia The Dominican Republic has been struck by aforce of nature that has left death and destruction in itswake in various parts of the country  The rain and thewind of Hurricane Jeanne had severe consequences forthe eastern part of our country, destroying homes,means of communication, bridges, crops and touristinfrastructure, at a time when the Dominican Republichad been making increasing efforts to jumpstart itseconomy  We take this opportunity to express ourthanks for the international community’s solidarity inthese difficult times for the Dominican Republic  Iwould also like to express my deepest thanks toSecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan, who has expressedsolidarity with our country and with Haiti in thecontext of this natural disaster The fact of globalization steadily deepensrelations among our countries, challenging our capacityto take advantage of the opportunities thatglobalization offers, as well as our capacity to limit itsnegative impact  Together with the contradictory andcomplex processes of integration and disintegration,our countries still hope that the benefits ofglobalization will create conditions making it possibleto overcome poverty and attain a good life A tragic event that occurred in this city of NewYork on September changed the destiny ofhumankind in a matter of minutes, and made the worldincreasingly dangerous and insecure  The promise oflasting peace presaged by the end of the cold war wasdestroyed by terrorist actions — actions which werecondemned by all humankind and which haveunleashed a steady escalation of violence that hasturned the world into a place of uncertainty We must spare no effort to rid humankind of thethreat of terrorism  We condemn terrorist acts in alltheir forms and manifestations, whatever their sourceand whomever may be affected, and want tounderscore the importance of international cooperationin the fight against that scourge, which should alwaysbe prosecuted in strict compliance with internationallaw, and, in particular, with human rights andinternational humanitarian law The Dominican Republic is founded on anunconditional commitment to the norms and principlesof international law, and particularly those that relate tothe peaceful settlement of disputes, the condemnationof the use of force, compliance in good faith withinternational treaties and the implementation of theresolutions of the United Nations and its deliberativebodies, including the General Assembly, the SecurityCouncil and the Commission on Human Rights We reaffirm the view to which countriescommitted themselves in May at the thirdSummit Conference of Heads of State and Governmentof Latin America and the Caribbean and of theEuropean Union, as set out in paragraph of theDeclaration of Guadalajara:“[A]n effective multilateral system, based oninternational law, supported by stronginternational institutions and with the UnitedNations at its centre, is essential for achievingpeace and international security, sustainabledevelopment and social progress ”However, in order to achieve those objectives wemust streamline, modernize and reform the entiremultilateral international system, a process that Statesmust support through respect for and compliance withthe resolutions adopted, without neglecting genuineand effective equitable regional participation Multilateralism is one of the main pillars of theforeign policy of the Dominican Republic, as can beseen by our participation and cooperation in allinternational forums  For that reason, we join thosenations that call for a thorough reform of the UnitedNations system, with a view to enhancing itsdemocratization and making it a more effectiveinstrument for States Members  That reform must begeared, first of all, towards strengthening the GeneralAssembly, the most important body of theOrganization, and the Security Council, in which thereis unequal geographical representation  We reiterate yetagain the suggestion that has been made for severalyears now: the Security Council should be expanded sothat Asia, Africa and Latin America can have twopermanent members, and the number of nonpermanentseats should be increased in order to democraticize thedecisionmaking mechanism of that forum for peace Those reforms are necessary to make the multilateralsystem more agile and effective, so that it may moresuccessfully confront global threats and challenges I would like to echo the commitment undertakenby the heads of State or Government who met in SantoDomingo in August and adopted the Declaration ofSanto Domingo  in which we agreed that:“[t]he fight against poverty is essential to theconsolidation of democracy  In that regard, it isnecessary to formulate and implement publicpolicies aimed at strengthening economic growthand an equitable distribution of national incomeand wealth ”As we are all aware, the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) has reported that the richest per cent of Latin America’s population receives percent of national income, whereas the poorest percent of population receives only four per cent  This factis an attack on governability We want to underscore the importance of ameeting that was held at the United Nations lastweek — the gathering of world leaders in an allianceagainst hunger and poverty, which resulted in a seriouscommitment on the part of each and every one of ourrepresentatives here to fight unwaveringly andeffectively to achieve the agreed objectives For the Government of the Dominican Republic,the fight against corruption is a priority  We haveshown this by implementing mechanisms to preventand punish acts of corruption  That scourge has a graveimpact on the economies of our countries  We all knowthat the main victims of corruption are the poor  Weneed, above all, to strengthen existing mechanisms,and to produce others if necessary, in order to wage apitched battle against corruption and those who benefitfrom it, regardless of their origin or social class  Wehave taken this decision because we see that the rise incorruption in our region has jeopardized thegovernability of all of our countries  Governmentaltransparency and a greater participation of civil societyare necessary to combat this evil We wish to emphasize this morning theimportance and effectiveness of the followupmechanism for the implementation of the InterAmerican Convention Against Corruption, and its Planof Action adopted in Managua  Likewise, we ask thatour countries not be used as safe havens for personsconvicted of acts of corruption  We also advocate thereturn of those illgotten gains to the countries thathave fallen victim to this evil, which, together withdrug trafficking, has a negative impact on the stabilityof democracy and the enforcement of the rule of law In recent years, Dominican Republic has madereal progress in its struggle against trafficking inpersons, where the most vulnerable populations arewomen and children, whether at the regional orinternational level  Through the establishment ofnational and international networks against traffickingin Dominican children and adolescents, and with thecooperation of the diplomatic foreign and consularservices, we have made great strides in that area  Wetake this opportunity to emphasize the participation ofthe International Organization for Migration and itsimportant support in this struggle As for the struggle of countries against themanufacture and illicit trade in small arms and lightweapons, our country is committed to assisting in theareas of investigation and the adoption of measures forstrengthening global and regional cooperation in orderto fight against this scourge  States must continue tomake every effort to implement the Programme ofAction adopted by the United Nations Conference onthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons inAll Its Aspects We also want to express our deep concern at thehigh level of kidnappings and crime in our countries —a level that increases year after year, thus worseningthe sense of insecurity felt by persons of all socialclasses and races  The rise in crime is a threat to thesecurity and safety of our citizens and to thedemocratic governability of all of our countries  Welldesigned deterrence mechanisms based on zerotolerance, an efficient police force, and a strengthenedjudiciary will all be necessary to reduce this scourge,which has a significant impact on the lives of ourcitizens On a different topic, the Caribbean now has thesecond highest incidence of HIV/AIDS in the world We invite the Member States of the United Nations torededicate themselves to the terms of the Declarationof Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted at the specialsession of the General Assembly on June Dominican legislation includes law onHIV/AIDS, which is now in the process of beingreformed and which represents one of the few existingpieces of legislation in our region regarding thatdisease  We reiterate the request for cooperation to theinternational community so that, through financing, thecountries most seriously affected can have moreresources to deal with the consequences of that illnessin order to provide the comprehensive care that is verynecessary, as well as the antiretroviral medications tocombat the illness  This is based on the right of allcitizens to life and health In recent years and in most international forums,our country has referred to the grave crisis confrontingthe sister republic of Haiti  We have drawn attention tothe fact that the Dominican Republic could not andcannot bear the weight of this crisis and itsconsequences on its shoulders alone  On more than oneoccasion we have called on the internationalcommunity for solidarity  We do so with the intent ofbeginning a farreaching process that can help infinding a solution to this problem  Today, we see thatovercoming this crisis represents a major challenge tothe United Nations, and therefore we support theprocess that began through the United NationsStabilization Mission in Haiti  We consider it veryimportant that the Haitian people see this peacefulmission as the participation of the internationalcommunity in the stabilization of their nation, and thatthey at no time view it as an occupation force Hurricane Jeanne has caused thousands of deathsand much destruction in the area of Gonaïves, Haiti,thus deepening the economic and humanitarian crisis inthat country  Now, more than ever, we call on theinternational community and international financialbodies to provide the necessary financial resources thatcan place that nation on the path toward stability andprogress Many regions of the world have not yet achievedthe peace to which they aspire  Despite all the effortsundertaken in that regard, innocent people continue tolose their lives in a conflict that for decades hascharacterized the instability of the Middle East The Dominican Republic avails itself of thisforum to reaffirm its unrestricted support for the peaceprocess begun between Israel and Palestine during theMadrid Conference, for the Oslo Agreements, forthe recommendations made by United States SenatorGeorge Mitchell in his final report and for the roadmap presented by President George Bush andsupported by Russia and the European Union Finally, the Dominican Republic reiterates itsposition, expressed in various forums, on the need for aconstructive dialogue between the nations located onboth sides of the Straits of Taiwan in order to ensurepeace and security in that region I conclude by expressing the hope that thisoccasion has enabled the Governments represented atthis meeting to reflect seriously on our destiny — thedestiny of all men and women who live on Earth —and also that the United Nations will be able, with thecooperation of States, to establish the balancenecessary for the benefit of international peace andsecurity  Five years ago I had the honour to address the fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, when I was head of the delegation of my country, the Dominican Republic  Since then, I have not taken any personal part in the interesting debates of this distinguished international institution, and it is only indirectly, through the Foreign Ministry of my country, that I have been able to follow from a distance the difficult, complicated and laborious progress of this Organization, upon which humanity gazes with anxious and fearful faith On returning to this solemn gathering, entering once again this great laboratory of international political thought, where noble and courageous ideas are struggling to make righteousness prevail, to ensure the certainty of moral and material peace, and to achieve lasting and permanent security, it is only natural that I should draw a comparison between the United Nations of yesterday — since everything that lives has its yesterday, its today and possibly its tomorrow — and the United Nations of today We must all recognize the merits of the tremendous work which has been accomplished during the last five years by the United Nations  Its dynamic nature has proliferated in more and more activities; its indefatigable enterprise has created new agencies, its efforts have spread to ever wider horizons  For all these things this honourable institution deserves the gratitude and applause of the nations of the world; but activity, initiative and effort are all the more praiseworthy in proportion as they attain the goals which they set out to attain The greatest brains of our time in the political, economic and scientific world have contributed the best of their Intelligence to bringing about the success of the immense project inaugurated by the Charter of the United Nations, which was signed in San Francisco a little more than ten years ago  No other attempt ever made to solve the vital problems of nations was begun with more determination, or was aided by better men and a more united goodwill than this one  Consequently, if the United Nations is still far from achieving what was and continues to be its supreme aspiration, this is not because it has lacked the cooperation of the best minds, or because its servants, with true devotion to duty, have been grudging of their valour, resolution and loyalty It is possible that the underlying cause of the situation to which I refer is rooted in the very document which served as a birth certificate for the United Nations  I refer to the Charter signed at San Francisco The founders of the United Nations, that is, those who signed the Charter in  were honest enough to foresee that their work could be improved on, since no work of man is endowed with absolute and lasting perfection  It was for this reason that among the provisions of Chapter XVIII of the Charter, under the heading  “Amendments”, they included Article  And in obedience to this wise display of foresight, the General Assembly, on November  at its eight session, adopted its resolution (VIII), requesting the SecretaryGeneral to prepare certain documentation for the purpose of facilitating, during the tenth regular session of the General Assembly, the consideration of the question of calling a general conference for the aforementioned purpose,And for this reason also, the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, Mr  Hammarskjold, addressed his note of July [A/ to the Member States, drawing their attention to paragraph of Article of the Charter and informing them that the provisional agenda of the tenth session of the General Assembly would include an item entitled “Proposal to call a General Conference of the Members of the United Nations for the purpose of reviewing the Charter”  The SecretaryGeneral concluded by listing in this note the documentation which he had prepared in conformity with resolution (VIII) No matter how serious  — as they most certainly are — certain other subjects before the tenth session of the General Assembly may be considered, there is no item that demands more immediate attention than this one, because no other item is of such importance to the world and to the very existence of the United Nations itself  We are all aware that this subject touches a sensitive spot  We are all aware that the four simple words “review of the Charter” produce a hostile reaction in certain quarters  But it is necessary that I refer to this subject, because although the United Nations has done a great deal of work and achieved some positive results during the past five years, it is no less certain that, with respect to the fair, logical and scientific revision of its Charter, it has made absolutely no progress since and its movements have remained frozen like those of a paralytic, while the waters of time have flowed onward, in their course throughout a whole decade On the other hand, when the founders of the United Nations — including the “Big Five” — signed the Charter, they thereby confirmed the complete validity of all its texts, including, naturally, Article  Consequently the signing of that Charter, including Article  constituted a recognition of the fact that revision was possible, and a moral and material obligation to respect this possibility  And L am not aware that any formal reservation was made with respect to this Article To postpone a problem is not to solve it  To dose one’s eyes in order not to see a conflict does not eliminate or diminish it  There is no material peace where there is no moral peace, and there is no moral peace where there is no justice  It is the request, demand, claim, supplication and entreaty of our Charter that it should be enabled to become more and more equitable every day If justice, peace and security are aspirations which increase in proportion to the cruelty of war, then no generation of mankind has ever been in more urgent need of such moral and material consolation than the people of the twentieth century  And, paradoxically, the people of the twentieth century are living closer to the threat of physical destruction than any other generation in the entire history of our planet  The more they need and seek for peace, the more they are beset and threatened by war  The greater and more lasting the peace they seek, the more destructive and ferocious is the war they find  The implacable neutrality of science, which places the inexhaustible arsenal of its secrets at the service of both pacifists and militarists, seems to permit the best and greater part of its inventions to be snatched up by the latter than by the former In days gone by, groups of nations and States had a complex function  They served equally for common defence, collective aggression, or for the establishment of balanceofpower systems which in the long run always proved unstable or temporary  Peace was a commodity which could be sold, purchased, or negotiated  In a word, none of the alliances or associations between States had, as its final purpose, the establishment of peace without asking a price, without setting timelimits, without imposing coercive conditions It is the people of today, labouring under the burden of great wars, who have forged the concept of peace as a right which men should enjoy as naturally and freely as light and air  It is the people of the Americas in particular, the free men of the Americas, who seem to have welcomed, and tried to preserve, this simple, humane and precious idea In this century of great wars, we have witnessed two tremendous efforts to associate States for the main purpose of peace: the establishment of the League of Nations and that of the United Nations  The League of Nations, born in the first postwar period, was unable to withstand the powerful tidal wave of the Second World War  Today, the United Nations is the mast which holds aloft, against threatening gusts, the flag of universal faith and hope Before and after the establishment of these two great organizations, regional units were formed, based on local geographical and political factors, which sought simultaneously to promote the success of the great organizations and to further their particular interests  Bolivar, the founder of countries and unifier of nations, worked to this end in Latin America and began the movement toward a union of Spanish American countries which culminated in the Treaty of Union, League and Perpetual Confederation signed in Panama on July by the representatives of Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Central America  This initial act on the part of the liberator has borne fruit in ten interAmerican conferences, held in Washington, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Santiago de Chile, Havana, Montevideo, Lima Bogota and Caracas respectively, which have shaped the unity of the political thought of this hemisphere, characterized by peaceful solidarity and the cardinal principle of nonintervention,If we compare what is happening in the Americas with what has happened in the world at large, we shall arrive at the following conclusions: the League of Nations, created by the Treaty of Versailles in June  was formed of and by the group of victor nations of the First World War, and the United Nations, created by the San Francisco Conference, in June  was formed of and by the group of victor nations of the Second World War  That is to say, both international institutions came into existence as improvised groups of victors, which expressly excluded the vanquished and even nations which were merely neutral or displeasing to them  For this reason, neither ever possessed, nor possesses, the necessary conditions of stability for a genuine world organization  The ideas of universality and discrimination are absolutely incompatible with one another  Consequently, these international institutions devoted themselves to organizing victory — their victory — rather than to organizing peace  I do not think that this road will ever lead to a peace without a victor, to a general, truly universal, indivisible peace, having the character, functions and permanence of something belonging to everybody and intended for everybody The Americas have adopted different and more advanced procedures  The interAmerican system, in the broad, noble and peaceful sense of the phrase, did not rise spontaneously like a ghost from the battlefields, bringing the scars and bloody bandages to the conference halls and still carrying upon its shoulders the dead bodies of the vanquished  It arose from the bloodless field of the international American conferences and the consultative meetings of the Foreign Ministers of the different republics of the hemisphere  To create this system, its members did not have to present imposing records of military service, nor were any of them stopped at the door and asked whether they were victors or vanquished  It was simply enough for them to be free men and to love the peace of the Americas and the peace of the world InterAmericanism was not created in haste, nor following a feverish military crisis, nor in an atmosphere still reeking with the smoke and sweat of the battlefield; it was not created with discriminatory prejudices between great and small, greater and less, nor with distinctions between permanent and nonpermanent members nor shackled with the iron manacles of the veto, the instrument of unilateral policy  InterAmericanism was born of that process of prudent slowness in which time and experience collaborate like wise counsellors  Within its framework there is neither great nor small, nor any situation in which one Member State can impose its own will, directly or indirectly, on all the others  Within this system the democratic principle of majority rule can freely exercise its equalizing function  A child of peace, it advances towards peace with filial loyalty and in a spirit of democratic equality  As an international institution, the Organization of American States does not look to the past, where there are no differences for it to adjust or punish, but to the future, for it is only in the  future that we can and ought to find a better world The United Nations must really unite in a desire to review the Charter and bring it up to date  This Charter must not continue to enforce the discriminatory practice whereby some nations can be condemned to exile and prevented from being heard in the very forum where the destiny of the world, and therefore their own destiny, is being decided  These distinctions between great and small Powers, between permanent and nonpermanent members, and these authoritarian councils where the desires and interests of all can be fettered by the will of a single, privileged, permanent member, are incompatible with the spirit of the age and with our present conception of States  If the great wars of this century were waged for the salvation of democracy, what is the United Nations making of the principle of majority rule  Who will uphold the claim that the minority, reduced to its minimum of a single unit, should continue to impose its will on all the rest It is well that the rights of majorities and the rights of minorities should be adjusted freely according to their just and proportionate shares  However, the alternative, which is what we are now witnessing, is nothing but the confirmation in power of a despotism which has overflowed national boundaries to become an international force  This is not what the nations intended, when they met in San Francisco in to draw up their Charter  And if that huge gathering of victors, out of the necessities of the moment and in order to capitalize their victory, acted wrongly, it is now time for them to revise their Charter so that it may better serve the interests of the moral and material peace of mankind The democratic world did not engage in the bloodiest of all wars so that a single will could impose its despotic wishes upon all nations by making use of the very instrument that was forged for purposes of world peace and equal and lasting justice  If the United Nations, bearing on its escucheon the blot of the veto, is being used for these purposes, it is either because; it has reversed its historic function, or because its founding Charter is defective, or because these two reasons together are conspiring against its reputation, against its stability, and against its very existence If humanity today meets with injustice, let us  endeavour to make sure that this injustice cannot be imputed to the Charter of the United Nations  Let us recognize that it is frequently attributable to other causes  We are prepared to tolerate, for example, the fact that an important New York newspaper should have chosen the time when the Dominican Republic was honourably fulfilling a debt of humanity and friendship towards a friendly people by contributing several hundred thousand Dominican pesos — which are worth exactly as much as the same number of United States dollars — to the victims of the recent floods in the United States, that it should have chosen this time to launch a violent attack on my Government and others  Yes, we can tolerate this situation, since the Press is free, and any one is free to assess the facts and see them or not see them as they are, and free to remember or not to remember the history of my country  But let us not resign ourselves to hearing the same or similar remarks made about our own Charter, merely through want of just and timely amendment The Dominican Republic, as a founder Member of the United Nations, has at all times been faithful and loyal to the Charter  The ideas I have expressed here are not aimed to satisfy any nationalist interest, but are an attempt to do honour and contribute improvements to the basic document which was drawn up by the peoples of the United Nations for the purpose of guiding them in the search for universal peace, progress and security  These are the plain reasons which have led the delegation of the Dominican Republic to advocate the establishment, at this tenth session of the General Assembly, of an ad hoc committee to make a calm and impartial study of the revision of the Charter, a study which will no doubt culminate in the convocation of the General Conference envisaged ten years ago in Article My delegation, representing one of the Governments which has willingly fulfilled, and continues to fulfil, its responsibilities to the United Nations, offers its full and disinterested assistance in pursuing the aforesaid purposes  In so doing, it proposes to demonstrate its devotion to the United Nations Charter and to help make that instrument as nearly perfect as possible,  in the interests of universal justice, peace and security  At the outset, I wish to express my congratulations to the President of the General Assembly upon his election to preside over the Assembly at its sixtyeighth session  I wish him the greatest of success in his task and in his efforts to promote the initiatives proposed for his term I am here as a representative of the Dominican Republic, which was one of the signatories in of the Charter of the United Nations, which entrusts the Organization with the monumental task of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war  In the years since its inception, there has not been another world war, but today we are facing a cataclysm that is just as lethal and destructive as a war of planetary dimensions: global poverty  It is a war with casualties in the millions, which calls for a radical change in the economic paradigm and for the forging of a new culture — the culture of sustainability  As I address the \\x0cAssembly, there is no doubt in my mind that to triumph over such a daunting challenge, all nations must make difficult decisions, which will require the full weight of our collective responsibility Allow me to refer to the extensive and detailed document adopted at the Rio de Janeiro United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+ last year (resolution  annex), entitled “The future we want”  In that text, Member States renewed their commitment to sustainable development and to the promotion of a future that is sustainable in economic, social and environmental terms for our planet and for present and future generations  That declaration shows that the leaders of the world’s nations are committed to doing what is needed to attain that future  We therefore have a road map with profound implications Let us acknowledge that we are taking on an overwhelming responsibility, because we are committing ourselves to building a reality that is totally unprecedented in the modern world  Let us acknowledge that development to date has not been sustainable in any way  It has not been sustainable either socially or economically  It has been even less sustainable in environmental terms  The systems of production that we have used to achieve economic growth have been based on methods that have proved to be harmful to the environment, and the systems that we have used to distribute the wealth produced have created deep chasms of social inequality and exclusion Over time, we have reached a situation that we now consider to be intolerable: a world in which more than billion people are living in a state of extreme poverty and hunger; a world in which many millions of human beings lack adequate health care, drinking water, goodquality education or decent employment; and a world in which extreme malnutrition and social exclusion prevail to a morally unacceptable extent  If we aspire to a world where development is sustainable, we must first accept our shared responsibility for all parts of all societies, and agree that it is time for actions, not words To translate a commitment of such a magnitude into reality, it must be based on achievable actions and attainable goals, and we must be prepared to take bold action, as we are doing in the Dominican Republic, on several unprecedented fronts  We are putting citizens at the centre of our policies and making the fight against poverty and inequality our top priority  We are implementing a new development model based on a longterm national strategy built on the pillars of three fundamental social pacts: a fiscal pact, a pact for education and a pact for electricity  We are building transparency into Government actions and establishing citizens’ groups to oversee and monitor purchasing and contract systems  We are making support for smallscale agricultural producers a priority  We are doubling the budget for free and compulsory public education  We are extending the school day, and we are putting a permanent end to illiteracy Following the commitments made at the Rio+Conference, we have taken a few steps forward and are moving towards an agreement on a road map that will lead us to sustainable development and to the eradication of extreme poverty  We have implemented a process to determine as accurately as possible what the sustainable development goals for the postinternational development agenda should be We are pleased to note that we all agree that the greatest challenge the world faces is to eradicate poverty and, for that reason, that goal has been given top priority on the agenda of our people and our Organization Our countries have common problems, but our economic, social, historical, geographical, demographic and cultural realities are different  Each of those dimensions plays a role in how those problems may or may not be addressed and resolved  Moreover, our responsibilities for the creation of or the aggravation of those common problems, such as climate change, are clearly differentiated My country, the Dominican Republic, suffers the consequences of climate change, because of its geographical location in the path of annual hurricanes and tropical storms  For that reason, we are working to strengthen and improve our preparedness for the management of risks associated with natural disasters  We are building a collection centre for emergency assistance and are working on the creation of a centre of excellence, dedicated to the education and training of human resources for assistance in disasters, which will serve the nations in the entire Caribbean region Next month, from to November, the Dominican Republic will host the third International Conference on the HOPEFOR initiative, to which all Members of the United Nations are cordially invited Universal sustainable development is a goal that requires a new vision and approach on the international stage  In order for development to be sustainable in our nations, we must undertake structural reforms that \\x0cwill change many of our policies and our economic and social systems, turning them inside out, the way a sock is turned inside out  With sustainable development, we have taken on a commitment of biblical proportions, a universal commitment to care for our brothers and sisters, especially for those who most need to be elevated to the conditions required for adignified human life The Organization is helping to point the way with the launch of parallel processes of study, discussion and analysis; panels of eminent persons; consultations with regional economic commissions; the Leadership Council of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network; and the openended working groups that are contributing to marking the path We would therefore like to take the opportunity to express our appreciation for the work done by SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon in putting documents in the hands of Member States that will serve as a guide for our debates and our decisions  One such document, An Action Agenda for Sustainable Development, a report prepared for the SecretaryGeneral in June by the Leadership Council of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, is a bold and optimistic platform  It is an exhaustive and practical plan that requires a collective commitment that we cannot shirk  All reports agree that we cannot continue treating the part of the planet that each of our nations occupies as if the resources that nature has generously put within them were inexhaustible  The world’s forests, water supplies and mineral resources are decreasing, and animal species are endangered  At the same time, we continue to use methods of cultivation that poison or impoverish the Earth and methods of industrial production that poison the air we breathe We must revise the very methods by which our economic growth is driven  That is not a new concern for the United Nations  We have been talking about sustainable development for decades  What is new now is that the situation has become a matter of urgency The time for words and promises is over  The time for action is now  We must step up the pace to establish the foundations of sustainable development, because time is running out  We must address the purpose, knowing that what we do or do not agree upon in this session of the General Assembly may determine whether the future of our peoples, or rather, the future of humankind, will be promising or miserable  That presumption may seem exaggerated to representatives of larger or more highly developed nations  If so, we invite those nations to look beyond their borders and to consider the peoples of the nations from which they seek cheap labour  They must look at the peoples whose human resources they employ to produce their goods and services  They must look at the peoples in the countries that need the industries of the developed countries to process their mineral exports and at the peoples in the countries where they want to market their products For many of those people, the situation is intolerable  That is why we are pleased to note that the documents that have already been written and which are intended to serve as a platform for our debates and decisions have an optimistic tone  They give us, for example, the assurance that if we act now, the problems we face will not become insoluble Universal sustainable development, which addresses the challenges that have been so clearly identified, will translate into social justice in the world  It will also translate into peace, international peace, the achievement of which is a strategic goal of the Organization To speak of eradicating extreme poverty, measured in terms of living on an income of less than $a day, sounds like an enormous goal, especially because it is estimated that some billion people in the world suffer from poverty  In reality, that is just one step in a long journey  If those who are now below the income level of $per day are elevated to an income level of $per day, we will have eliminated what we now call extreme poverty  However, we all know that human beings cannot meet their basic needs on an income of $per day  The difference in hardship between the one income range and the other is not very noticeable  What happens is that talking about poverty in statistical terms does not allow us to visualize, much less feel, the reality of the human misery and desolation behind the numbers and the percentages  How can we understand the pain of a father and mother who have suffered the loss of their child when the words in which we are informed about that family tragedy are that every seconds a child dies from hungerrelated causes in the world Let us put ourselves in the place of parents of families living in a state of extreme poverty  They have to raise their children in extremely unsafe living conditions, without sanitation or safe drinking water, without sufficient resources to buy medicine or to provide each child with food to ensure proper nutrition, \\x0cwithout resources, without a bed or mosquito net to protect him from insects that transmit serious diseases  They have to decide which of their children can go to school and which cannot, or which of their children have to work and which do not We know that a difficult road still remains ahead before we can agree on a satisfactory arrangement for all in regard to the postinternational development agenda and the most effective ways to implement it  Let us remember that what we need is not a new commitment  We have had many commitments to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger  We have had the World Food Summit of  the Millennium Summit in  another World Food Summit five years later in  and the recent Rio+Conference in  What we need now is for those commitments to finally be translated into political action Although sustainable development may sound like an economic concept, it really is a political concept  That is why we are discussing it here, at the Organization, which is a forum of States and therefore a political forum  Economists measure the dimensions or the pillars of reality in economic terms  Economists and other specialists can set the goals that must be reached for a sustainable development that meets their exact specifications  But political decisions are the driving force  Political decisions are what ultimately determine whether or not the goals are achieved We therefore have the primary responsibility  It depends on us to put the declarations of good intentions into action  \\ufeffIt is a great honour for me to participate in the fortysecond session of the United Nations General Assembly First, Sir, I wish, on behalf of the Government and people of the Dominican Republic and on my own behalf, to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly  That decision was made on the basis of your wellknown personal and professional skills and experience in international affairs  These qualities will undoubtedly enable you to make a significant contribution to the success of our meetings I take this opportunity to extend a cordial greeting to your predecessor, Mr  Choudhury of Bangladesh, and thank him for the competent and authoritative way in which he carried out the duties of President at the last session On behalf of the Dominican Government, I also have pleasure in extending warm greetings to the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations Mr  Javier Perez de Cuellar, and assuring him of our appreciation and gratitude for his praiseworthy and valiant efforts in pursuing the purposes of our Organization The maintenance of peace and respect for the principle of nonintervention are unalterable elements of the foreign policy of my country, as set forth in our fundamental law and supported by our practice in international relations Negotiation and dialogue are for my country the ideal instruments for the achievement and maintenance of peace, both nationally and internationally  Without peace there can be no economic progress or social development Peace is not merely the absence of war or peace imposed by a superior force  Peace imposed by fear, conditional upon a balance of destructive power, is despicable and transitory  The fear of a nuclear cloud enveloping out planet prevents the full development of the human intelligence that would make possible the creation of conditions in which mankind could enjoy the material and spiritual benefits of this world  For this reason the Dominican Republic welcomes with hope the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union that will make it possible to establish conditions for the elimination of mediumrange nuclear missiles  We join the other speakers who have already applauded this step in the Assembly One basis for peace is humane treatment of and solidarity with immigrants, be they undocumented aliens, political refugees or fugitives from war zones  That is why the Dominican Republic is taking the opportunity offered by this Assembly to consider one of the most harmful practices in this respect discrimination with regard to the mobility of factors of production  It is a littleknown fact, but a fact none the less, that most of the countries represented here practise some kind of discrimination in their immigration policies Emigration from our countries is a consequence of the worst economic crisis that virtually the whole of America has suffered since the   Despair and hunger force many people to leave their countries, homes, families and friends in search of something better  Is it just and charitable to treat our brothers who set out on that painful Odyssey so harshly and contemptuously  To do so is to undermine the foundations upon which the longedfor peace must be based The Dominican Republic is convinced that the basis of a fruitful peace is, among other things, the gradual elimination of the protectionist barriers that prevent the free flow of international trade  Those barriers favour certain monopolistic interests, both political and economic·, they increase unemployment and inflation in the countries that take shelter behind this policy Protectionism, whether by raising tariff barriers or by imposing quotas, is a twoedged sword that harms producers and consumers equally, to the benefit of a minority  It is extremely difficult, not to say impossible, to quantify the effects of increased protectionism upon our economies  The predictable result, however, is that the path of protectionism leads to the worldwide contraction of international trade Protectionism may benefit some, but only in the short term for in the end it harms everyone, including the protectionists themselves  Free, vigorous world trade, unhampered by quotas, is indispensable to the wellbeing of the world economy  Every protectionist measure removes us further from that objective  We must, therefore, all move together towards a process of liberalization of world trade·, but for that purpose, it is necessary that more countries accede to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),Our position on the problem of foreign debt is welldefined  Our country is not in a position to honour the debtservicing scheduled, particularly considering the precarious levels of our foreign exchange resources  What is needed, therefore, is a programme that will reconcile what the country should pay and what it can pay, always bearing in mind that economic growth and the subsistence of our: people must not be sacrificed  With regard to our debt to commercial banks, we press for the concession of longer grace and repayment periods by the World Bank and the substantial reduction of the interest rates on that debt  As regards our bilateral debt, we firmly believe that for the achievement of bilateral negotiations it is not necessary for us to reach a prior agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMP) , In this regard we have publicly stated our intention to restructure our commitments with the Paris Club whether or not there exists a financing programme with the Fund  We share the view that the countries members of the Paris Club should urgently revise their restructuring policies in order to permit multilateral agreements with debtor countries On the multilateral debt, our country considers it absolutely necessary, precisely at this time of financial crisis, for international development banks and multilateral agencies to maintain a net positive flow of resources to our countries  Otherwise debt servicing to these institutions will become virtually impossible  What is required is the greatest possible flexibility on the part of International bodies as regards the repayment of the loans, their methods of procedure, credit policies and a greater supply of concessional resources Concerning SouthSouth debt, my country hopes that the financial relations of payment and repayment of external debt with developing countries may be framed in terms of new patterns of compensation, bearing in mind the relative levels of development and the availability of reserves in each of our countries We must all make a determined effort to eradicate the inequalities brought about by social maladjustment which provoke international social agitators, who take a heroic stance in their actions but are no more than criminals On terrorism my country believes that at this fortysecond session the General Assembly should unanimously adopt a resolution appealing to all Governments to set in motion the provisions of General Assembly resolution of  Any other course would be a waste of time  We cannot establish distinctions between social agitation and the legitimate struggle of oppressed peoples  Another threat to peace is the growing traffic in drugs, a far worse evil than nuclear clouds  We must therefore launch a publicity campaign under the auspices of this world Organization to ensure that, utilizing the most modern and sophisticated means of mass communication, we can inform mankind about the dangers represented by the consumption of and traffic in drugs  As repression has so far proved ineffectual, it would be better to work for a drop in consumption, which would hurt the drug traffic My country wishes to emphasize the grave danger to mankind of the spread of AIDS (acquired immunedeficiency syndrome) with its serious consequences  As was recently pointed out by the Holy Father Pope John Paul II, this is a grave crisis  It has been shown that this illness is not only spreading throughout economically and culturally disadvantaged areas but is also increasing in civilized regions, where its advance has taken on alarming proportions My delegation proposes that the United Nations should foster research to find a remedy for this illness} that fellowships be created to help laboratories look into the origin and cause of the disease; and that a data bank be established for the exchange of information about it  This is a matter that is as important as, if not more important than, the other threats mentioned previously, such as nuclear weapons, external debt, protectionism, discrimination against immigrants and the drug traffic My delegation also believes that great importance attaches to the problem of the elderly  Many years have elapsed since the General Assembly at its thirtyseventh session adopted its resolution endorsing the International Plan of Action on Aging  In view of the enormous magnitude and growing complexity of the question of aging, the Government of the Dominican Republic considers that the time has come for the United Nations to adopt a declaration on the rights of the aged and that the Governments of all countries, developed and developing, should lend their sponsorship to this matter so that this sector of the population, to which we shall all ultimately belong, may occupy its rightful place in the community and in society in general In our judgement it would also be beneficial to convene in  the tenth anniversary of the Vienna Conference, a second world assembly on aging at which we would use the same Kind of complementary measures employed so successfully at the International Conference on Population held in Mexico City in and at the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women held in Nairobi in  With respect to the measures adopted by the Dominican Government to avert the economic crisis, I must say that these have been very appropriate In the fiscal area, the aim we have set for ourselves is that of significantly reducing our fiscal deficit until we make it less than per cent of our gross domestic product  Bearing in mind that during the past year this deficit was in the order of per cent of the gross national product, such a reduction of our deficit would imply a drastic reduction in the inefficiency of our economic system  To bring about this significant reduction in the deficit, we are applying important administrative and structural reforms in our economic policy Before reducing its expenses, the Dominican Government is introducing the reform of a fiscal system, designed to simplify our tax structure, to increase its elasticity and to rationalize our tariff system  What has been achieved so far this year indicates that the savings for the central Government were five times greater than for the same period last year  This has helped to bring about the duplication of capital expenditure and the reduction of deficits as programmed  The structural reforms include privatisation of State sugarcane lands by sale to the private sector so that the lands may be used for the development of agricultural and tourist projects Another structural reform is integration of the production and sale of electric power into the private sector  In the Dominican Republic, this public service has so far been supplied by a State monopoly in a very inefficient manner There would be little use in my country applying an economic policy directed outside, increasing national savings and reorienting the role of Government with regard to the economy if there were not a supportive policy on the part of the industrialized countries with whom we conduct trade  From these industrial nations we require a renovation of the process of liberalization of international trade  We would request them to reduce their subsidies to exports since these are prejudicial to our people  The first world must avoid restrictions on its imports so that the exports of the third world will not suffer Some industrialized countries should promote a reduction in their real interest rates even if to do this they have to reduce their excessive budget deficits  Moreover, the International Bank could contribute by reducing the margins charged for its loans, especially for those countries that are going through an adjustment process  We could create amongst all of us defensive techniques that would enable us to face future increases in interest rates — for example through the use of compensatory financing facilities by the International Monetary Fund (IHF) , There is little sense in our having net flows towards the IMF or the World Bank when we could be obtaining from them greater resources than those which we are paying, and precisely when we most need such flows The industrialized countries could contribute new funds to the international organizations so that these, in turn, could be channelled to our countries  Latin America will need some $billion annually in coming years  The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  the World Bank  and the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB) are being called upon to do their share, especially in the short term  These institutions are capable of expanding their cofinancing operations and partial guarantees of private loans The first objective of ray Government global economic policy is to establish selfsustaining economic growth so as to continue expanding employment and per capita income for the population  In view of the growing external indebtedness, my authorities are responding and mobilizing as many material and human resources as possible for the promotion of economic growth and achieving a rate of real growth of approximately per cent per annum during a large part of this year My Government second objective is to face responsibly the problems of external debt  In so far as we are complying with the deadline agreed to we are requiring out creditors to accept that these be paid in the roost feasible manner and without extraordinary sacrifices by the people Along with those objectives we are working to distribute income more equitably, but not simply by taking away from some to give to others rather, by educating all to produce and create wealth  We recognize that the solution to our poverty is not to divide our wealth amongst more people but to increase that wealth so that it can be better distributed among all  Economic growth is the best means we have to do so, and in that way respond to the essential needs of our population To attain those objectives we are orienting our external economic policy  promoting exports, foreign investment and tourism, and requiring more efficient import substitution  To expand our external trade we are seeking a competitive and realistic exchange rate, and trying to avoid protectionist excesses to which we are so inclined With regard to the balanceofpayments problems, we are trying to remove the temptation to increase State intervention  Experience has taught us that the final result of such interventions tends to be a wasting of resources and a private sector which is more independent of the Government  In addition, we cannot demand that others be less protectionist if we are not prepared to move towards increasingly free world trade We are seeking to stimulate the repatriation of the flight of capital and provide a more secure profitability  We hope truly to reward persons who save so that they can effectively contribute their savings to national endeavours  We are encouraging savings and discouraging consumption, paying attractive interest to those who save and eliminating the subsidies that still exist in our banking system Further, we are stimulating the entry of foreign capital, especially if it does not imply debts  Accordingly, within a few weeks the Dominican authorities will begin to permit the conversion of a considerable part of our external debt into investments  This conversion will significantly reduce our debt and its servicing; it will contribute positively to our economic growth and generate more employment and income for our population  The Dominican Republic has applied for admission into the Lome Group  Why Lomé  Because we have a reality before us: the need to rely on the support and solidarity of those industrialized nations which are members of the European Economic Community  The States members of that Community in the Lome framework are encouraging autonomous and sustained development of the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific; they accord more favourable treatment than the mostfavourednation treatment and the Generalized System of Preferences; and they implement technical and financial assistance for development in the form of subsidies and special hard and soft loans among other things The Dominican Republic is seriously concerned at the situation prevailing in various parts of the world where existing tensions and conflicts are endangering peace and stability  Our country reaffirms the need to foster national reconciliation in countries with divided communities  Similarly, we urge respect for the right of peoples to selfdetermination and for the principle that no State has the right to intervene by force of arms or in any other manner in the internal affairs of another State On the other hand, we are concerned at the indifference of some States with regard to the implementation of resolutions adopted by overwhelming majorities in the General Assembly with a view to solving extremely important questions for world security  This apathy calls into question the viability of the United Nations as an organization and thwarts its commitment to maintain international peace and security; moreover, it undermines internationalism and threatens the solvency of the United Nations It is necessary to strengthen the mandate of the United Nations and, at the same time, avoid any initiative that may weaken its capacity for action and its role as the universal instrument of peace  This Assembly has before it once again the same crises and conflicts about which it has debated for several sessions  This reflects the repetitive character of the Assembly debates and the scanty progress achieved in eliminating tensions and problems affecting the international community  The perpetuation of many conflicts is due essentially to nonobservance of the principles set forth in the Charter, lack of respect for the standards of conduct enshrined in international morality and law# and the absence of a determination by the parties concerned to find just and equitable solutions to the problems My Government reiterates the need for the immediate and complete withdrawal of foreign troops now in Afghanistan and urges all States to respect that country territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty  I express the firm hope that negotiations during the next round of talks will bring about a satisfactory resolution to end this long conflict# thus providing the Afghan people with an opportunity freely to exercise its right to selfdetermination in a genuine way  because that invasion of Afghanistan is a potential threat to peace  We applaud the mediation efforts of the SecretaryGeneral and once again express support for United Nations resolutions urging a peaceful solution There are today countries facing serious crises owing to external causes and pressures# such as Kampuchea and Chad  We support# to the extent of our possibilities# every effort being made to establish freedom and democracy in those regions The Dominican Republic has maintained a traditional position of support for Argentina legitimate claims over the Malvinas Islands; consistent with that traditional position we urge Argentina and the United Kingdom to make every effort to initiate the kind of talks called for in General Assembly resolution  Peace on the Korean peninsula is a matter of the greatest interest to the international community  However, the objective of unification of the communities of South and North Korea must not be brought about by force but by peaceful means  through dialogue and negotiation between the two parties, which should be resumed without preconditions or extraneous requirements My delegation considers that a concrete way to resume the dialogue would be through conversations between the Foreign Ministers of the two Koreas in conformity with the initiative formulated a few months ago by the Republic of South Korea May I now refer to Haiti, the nation with which we share our Island of Hispaniola, a country with which we are United by so many links that it would take a long time to enumerate them  The Haitian people and Government face an enormous task in achieving the aims they have set for themselves: freedom, democracy, work for all, and the creation of conditions that enable that people to enjoy its inalienable right to education and health  Only through exercise of their human rights will the inhabitants of Haiti be able to enjoy the fruits of this world, which its Creator has put here for us all  In this respect, the Haitian people needs the help of all of us, which does not imply foreign interference in its affairs  We support the statement made here along those lines by President Namphy·The Dominican Republic, for its part, is increasing its bilateral contacts with that sister republic to create a modern system between the two countries involving free bilateral trade; the mutual combating of deforestation; and the exchange of journalists, teachers and students so that we may each learn about the realities, needs and pains of the other and so that, for a given length of time; professionals from one country may practise In the other without discrimination  The Dominican Republic supports the efforts being exerted to bring an end to the fratricidal conflict in Central America  With hope we join in the agreement for peace recently signed by five Central American Presidents in Guatemala  That agreement should be encouraged in so far as it constitutes the basis upon which a commitment may be forged to establish democracy, ideological pluralism, freedom and respect in that longsuffering region of our hemisphere  We therefore unreservedly support the appeal made here recently by the President of Costa Rica, Mr  Oscar Arias Sanchez, for concord to prevail in Central America The Dominican Republic supports all efforts to bring an end to the long war between Iraq and Iran  In the light of the latest developments in the Persian Gulf, there arises an ominous question as to the world future: are we moving towards world conflict and reaching the point of no return  We hope that the desire for peace that has been shown by the Great Powers may prevail in those two nations and in their religious feelings A constant feature of my country foreign policy is our deep concern about the Middle East  Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our population includes people of both Arabic and Jewish origin, all of whom are contributing, in an extraordinary fashion, to the development of our country, in a true model of human coexistence  Why should that not be the case in the countries from which those Jewish and Arabic immigrants have come My country feels that the only way to achieve peace in the Middle East is through dialogue between the parties to the conflict based on the provisions of Security Council resolutions ( and (  The Dominican Republic maintains its position of unwavering friendship towards the peoples of that region  We do not believe that friendship with one of the countries of the region should result in discrimination against others  Such friendship should not be criticized; no country should be criticized for being on friendly terms with either of the parties to the conflict, as sometimes happens when a country helps one of them In conclusion, I have not dealt with all of the important items on our agenda  I come from a small country, but one that has the good fortune to have a great President, Mr  Joaquin Balaguer, whose modern conception of history enables him to be an insightful observer of the world scene  Thus we feel solidarity with all the peoples represented here who bear the burden of many problems like ours  For that reason, my country will be represented wherever there are appeals for solidarity, respect, and efforts for peace  We wish to live in a world in which nations large and small may have equal opportunities for the benefit of their citizens, and the right to enjoy the resources we should all enjoy without discrimination Our country has demonstrated that we have a stable democracy  In my country there are no political prisoners and no discrimination of any kind, religious or cultural  For this reason, our arms are open to all  Because of our history and our language, we are a country of the Caribbean and also a country of Latin America  That is why we wish to serve as a bridge between the two Americas so that peace may prevail in our continent  Mr  HENRIQUEZ UREÑA said that if ever the United Nations General Assembly had commenced its work in an atmosphere propitious to fruitful mutual collaboration it was on that occasion, when the world political horizon was again bright with hope  The General Assembly was meeting in an atmosphere of tranquillity under the leadership of a distinguished statesman, General Romulo, who could be described as the embodiment of the spirit of human kindness The task before the Assembly was not easy, nothing was more arduous than the effort to reconcile conflicting ideologies and interests  Good will, however, had power akin to faith, which moved mountains While the Assembly agenda covered a vast number of topics, the political items, which occasioned the great differences, were not as numerous as in the past; moreover, they had all been discussed previously The question of the disposal of the former Italian colonies was of primary importance  Mr  Henriquez Ureña hoped the Assembly would find an equitable and workable solution of the problem during that session; the position of the Dominican Republic thereon had already been clearly indicated and it would remain unchanged  Any solution designed to ensure the preparation of those former colonies for selfgovernment or independence, through an orderly process carried out under the supervision of the United Nations, would have the support of the delegation of the Dominican Republic The Dominican Republic maintained an equally firm attitude with regard to any problem involving respect for the independence and sovereignty of a State  For that reason it could not remain indifferent to another question which had already been debated in past sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, namely, the threat to the political independence and territorial integrity of Greece  Not only was the sacred principle of independence attacked by such threats but also another principle, that of nonintervention, which the American Republics had embodied in many treaties and declarations The defence of those principles assumed a special importance in the case of Greece, a country which occupied so high a place in the history of civilization through the farreaching influence of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Archimedes, Aeschylus and Anacreon, and the incomparable marble beauty of the mutilated Venus of Melos or the headless Victory of Samothrace Was it unusual then if peoples whose culture had been nourished by the lifegiving stream of Hellenic thought were united in their ardent desire to support and defend Greece when her independence was at stake  On the altar of that great idea Byron had laid down his life at Missolonghi, and the soul of humanity had been filled with wonder when the people of Greece, like David before Goliath, had risen up to engage in unrelenting war with the invading hosts of fascism and nazism, as if from the depths of the past the martial and harmonious strains of the Trytaean lyre had reechoed in their ears Fortunately, it would appear that the problem of Greece was approaching solution  There was ground for hope that normal, goodneighbourly relations would soon be reestablished between Greece and adjacent nations in spite of the mutual accusations arising from regrettable incidents, the responsibility for which each of the contending countries ascribed to the other  The frontier incidents, however painful they might have been, were not the essence of the problem, but only one of its consequences  The Assembly must go to the very heart of the question, and that could be done if all the parties concerned accepted the mediation of the United Nations with the greatest good will in an effort to find an amicable solution A similar procedure had been successfully employed in dealing with the Indonesian question which, although very different in substance and origin, offered a fine example of what could be accomplished by a spirit of good will  The parties concerned were discussing their problems under the aegis of the United Nations and there was a good prospect that an agreement could be reached on principles which might well be a prelude to a final solution In respect to Korea, the Government of the Dominican Republic had recognized its existence as an independent nation  The delegation of the Dominican Republic considered that for the time being the United Nations Commission on Korea, established for the purpose of cooperating in the solution of Korean problems, and in the first place the problem of the country’s unification, should not be dissolved With regard to the questions that still awaited settlement in Palestine, the delegation of the Dominican Republic expressed the firm belief that the protection of the Holy Places and free access thereto would be fully guaranteed in the Assembly by means of a definitive agreement on the subject  It likewise believed that practical solutions would soon be found for the problem of the Palestine refugees, to whose assistance the Government of the Dominican Republic had already contributed from its resources just as it had contributed, and in no small measure, to other humanitarian undertakings of the United Nations, such as the International Children Emergency Fund The activity of the United Nations in the economic and social fields had certainly been, and continued to be, very effective, although pessimists did not realize the full extent of the enormous work the Organization was accomplishing, since they considered only the difficulties constantly arising in connexion with political questions  However, apart from the fact that the Organization had, in more than one instance, achieved complete success in the political field and had settled more than one dispute which might have endangered world peace, the technical work it had accomplished, social as well as economic, juridical as well as cultural, was of inestimable value to humanity Mr  Henriquez Ureña reviewed the achievements of the United Nations in those fields: its action to promote the development of underdeveloped territories and technical assistance; the establishment of regional economic Commissions for Europe, Asia, the Far East and Latin America; the establishment of vast and very useful services, such as the international statistical services; the holding of the United Nations Scientific Conference on the Conservation and Utilization of Natural Resources  The United Nations had effectively contributed to the improvement of the legal and social status of women  The General Assembly, by its resolution (III) of December  had promulgated the first International Bill of Human Rights  By its resolution A (III) of December it had approved the Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, a forward step of surpassing importance in the international field  The General Assembly at its current session was to study another significant draft of vast social and juridical import, namely, the declaration of the rights and duties of States Mr  Henriquez Ureña concluded by saying that his enumeration of some of the undertakings and achievements of the United Nations was sufficient to indicate the great importance of the Organization’s work and efforts, and justified the view that it represented the last and supreme hope of mankind  \\ufeffI address this General Assembly griefstricken at the death of people in the tragicaviation accident yesterday in this city of New York Most of the individuals stricken were, like myself, ofDominican nationality  Our profound appreciation goesto the heads of State and Government, to Ministers andto representatives who have expressed theircondolences to the people and Government of theDominican Republic at this tragedy  I am much obligedto you, Sir On behalf of the Government of the DominicanRepublic I offer our congratulations to the President onhis election to the stewardship of this session of theGeneral Assembly, convinced as we are that he willindeed succeed in guiding this session in the very bestinterests, and for the good, of the internationalcommunity  Likewise, we offer our most heartfeltcongratulations to the SecretaryGeneral, Mr  KofiAnnan, on his having been awarded the Nobel PeacePrize  That honour, together with that bestowed uponthe United Nations, proves and ratifies the confidenceand recognition felt for the work being done by theinternational community represented in thisOrganization on behalf of all mankind Despite the fact that in September this year — onthe heels of the events of September in New Yorkand in Washington, D C  — the United Nations devoteda number of plenary meetings to the issue of terrorism,it is still today impossible for us to separate this fromthe other items that we must deal with on the agenda ofthis session  The significance of these tragicdevelopments is of such magnitude that it is imperativefor us, as a matter of conscience, to stop and think ingreater depth about their complexity and theirrepercussions on the history that it is our lot to have tolive through, and about the most relevant ways for usto prevent and combat this scourge  That is so becauseit is plain to see that in the time that has elapsedbetween September and these days of November, wehave managed to go further and into greater depth,gaining new insights about the terrorist phenomenon We absolutely agree with those who have alreadyspoken that terrorism cannot be justified in any way,and that the excuses some would seek to advance tovalidate these deeds based on the existence of certaineconomic, social, cultural or political situations, areunacceptable  However paradoxical it may seem tosome, the conviction has also been stressed that, whileterrorism is unjustifiable and inexcusable, it is in thosevery situations where terrorism finds its breedinggrounds, where frustrations and lack of prospects canfan hatred and irrationality, where being shut out andhaving no hope, being shunted to the sidelines andsuffering from poverty can incubate and give birth andimpetus to twisted feelings of indiscriminate andirrational vengeance Faced with the sad reality of the events of September just past, we are absolutely convinced thatthe direction set for us by the Millennium Summit wasthe right one, that is, the path of peace and offellowship among people  At that historic gathering therationale was analysed and the framework set foraction by the international community to promotehuman rights, security, disarmament, economicdevelopment, equality of nations, and the fight againsthunger, poverty, disease, exclusion, social, racial andgender prejudice, and the abandonment of children, thedisabled and the elderly  There can be no doubt thatthese are the priority objectives for the prevention ofviolence and crime, that is to say, for the struggleagainst wars, against genocide and against terrorism The full weight, pain and inhumanity of theprovocations of September must not divert us fromthe goals that we set for ourselves in the MillenniumSummit Declaration, nor draw us into anydisproportionate violence  When last month weaddressed this Assembly we stated that the most prizedvirtue, indeed the democratic essence of thisOrganization, that is of the United Nations, is itscommitment and determination to uphold respect forhuman rights  It follows that although we know thatterrorism is the antithesis of that virtue, we must nottherefore act to confront it while failing to live up tothe obligation to protect those very rights  While actingin a legitimate reaction of selfdefence, we should notbe overcome by a spirit of retaliation but should ratherseek to apply international law and justice  That is whythe Dominican Republic cannot ignore the politicalmeasures that surely will also contribute to preventingand combating terrorism  Thus, we must resolutelysupport Security Council resolution (,adopted on September, and feel ourselves alsobound by earlier resolutions and covenants the UnitedNations has worked out over time in its fight againstterrorism In the United Nations Charter highlighted asits core concern the need to preserve peace  That wasonly to be expected after a war that had brought deathto millions of human beings and had wreaked havoc inthe life of many nations  The time that has elapsed hasbrought us to the conviction that there is no better wayto preserve peace than to do all that we possibly can toprevent war  The United Nations is ever morenecessary to attain that end, because within it we findthe underpinnings for promoting a healthy and creativeunderstanding among nations  Our fidelity to thefoundations of the Organization must be backed up bya shared political will leading to actions that proveirrefutably that we believe in and live up to what wesay and promise The unanimous adoption of the MillenniumDeclaration, inasmuch as it represented a profoundcommitment by the vast majority of the world’sleaders, amounted to a kind of rebirth and renewal ofthe United Nations in coming to grips with theproblems and challenges confronting us in the twentyfirst century  In that Declaration it was decided to doall that we could to establish a just and lasting peace inaccordance with the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter, and the determination wasreaffirmed to support all efforts aimed at ensuring thesovereign equality of States, respect for their territorialintegrity and political independence and the right toselfdetermination of peoples that remain undercolonial domination and foreign occupation That pledge makes it incumbent upon us to bringour full moral force to bear and to avail ourselves of allpossibilities afforded us by the machinery of theOrganization to resolve the conflicts that keep anumber of States around the globe in a state of war  Wehave no doubt whatever that the conflict between Israeland the Palestinian state must come to an end viacompliance with the multiple resolutions towards thatend that have emanated from the General Assembly,thus honouring what we agreed upon in thatMillennium Declaration Moreover, we set for ourselves the purpose ofspurring forward reform of the United Nations Charterand respecting the equality of the rights of nations Ratifying the Millennium Declaration means that therecan be no delay in turning the Security Council into abody that would respond to the historic realities of thepresent world and in establishing a logical set ofdemocratic balances based on those realities  It seemsto us fair for the nonpermanent members to participatein the Security Council via a rotational system thatwould give to all the same opportunity  By the sametoken, the Dominican Republic believes that it is also amatter of equity and historical realism for us to acceptthe Republic of China on Taiwan as a Member of theUnited Nations  Geopolitical reasons must not overridesituations of fact that have been recognized in bringingother States into the United Nations In the Millennium Declaration the problem ofglobalization was addressed with the following words:“We recognize that developing countriesand countries with economies in transition facespecial difficulties in responding to this centralchallenge  Thus, only through broad andsustained efforts to create a shared future, basedupon our common humanity in all its diversity,can globalization be made fully inclusive andequitable ” (resolution  para  As we speak, a Ministerial Meeting of the countriesmembers of the World Trade Organization (WTO) isbeing held in Doha, Qatar  Most countries with smalleconomies are rightfully calling for the fulfilment of allthe agreements of the Uruguay Round  We hope thatthey will not be saddled with unbearable new burdens,that their calls will be heard and that generoussolidarity and cooperation will be shown, as well asunderstanding of the imbalances, differences andasymmetries in the pace of development whencomparing rich countries to poor, small ones Among the objectives of the World TradeOrganization are respect for human rights,strengthening democracy and preserving theenvironment  All that will not be possible if the processof globalization is not carried out with a sincere andresolute determination to show understanding and toprovide cooperation and technical assistance to helpthe majority of the nations on this planet to achievedevelopment  How are we to understand the deadlinesset by the World Trade Organization for attainingcertain economic objectives, in some cases as soon asand in others  when the MillenniumDeclaration, aware of the inequalities and difficultiesfacing most nations, seeks to redress no sooner than— and only to a certain degree — the poverty ofmillions upon millions of human beings whose incomeis less than $a day  We hope that at the conferencesscheduled by the United Nations, such as theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment and the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment, light can be shed on these problems inan effective way, yielding equitable measures designedto reduce the inequalities separating peoples one fromthe other Allow me finally to refer to an aspect mostintimately tied to respect for and recognition of humanrights, something that also coincides with theMillennium Declaration inasmuch as it refers to thedemands of women and gender equality  Indeed, theInternational Research and Training Institute for theAdvancement of Women (INSTRAW), based in theDominican Republic, is one of the few United Nationsinstitutions located in a developing country, and theonly international institute devoted to research on andtraining for the advancement of women  The SecretaryGeneral, in his report to the General Assemblypresented in the Third Committee on October said that, notwithstanding the difficulties anduncertainties that INSTRAW has encountered in thelast two years it has managed to obtain the minimumresources for fulfilling the mandate assigned to it bythe Assembly and the Economic and Social Council He went on to say that inasmuch as the Institutehas begun to produce tangible results via theinformation system and contact networks in creating anawareness of gender issues, perhaps the Assemblywould wish to adopt a decision on how Institute wouldbe able to operate productively and costeffectivelybeyond the year Let us not let INSTRAW — that noble institution,a pioneer in the advancement of women, particularly ofwomen in developing countries — perish for lack ofresources  Let us make a consistent and generousgesture, demonstrating solidarity, so that the GeneralAssembly will ensure the continued existence of thisinstitution beyond this year of  by allocating inthe United Nations budget the funds necessary for it tocontinue to work towards its fruitful humanitarianends  Eight years after Switzerland became a full Member of the United Nations, we are delighted to see that the presidency of this General Assembly at its sixtyfifth session fell to the President of the Swiss Confederation, Mr  Joseph Deiss, to whom we wish the greatest success in his tenure   In  the twentieth special session of the General Assembly was held to contribute to the elimination or substantial reduction of the illegal production of drugs and drug abuse by  Ten years later, at a followup review meeting supported by this prestigious world body, the conclusion was reached that little progress had been made regarding the proposed goals and that there were therefore plenty of reasons for the international community to be concerned about the growing threat posed by the global drug problem  It was determined that a new year plan was needed to cover the period until  when the General Assembly will have once again to convene Member States in order to assess the outcome of measures implemented to eliminate the most serious threat to our citizens’ safety at the dawn of the twentyfirst century: transnational organized crime and illegal drug trafficking   Today, almost million people between the ages of and consume drugs worldwide  Although that consumption extends to many regions around the world, the highest concentration of users is found in areas with the most pronounced economic and social development, such as the United States, Western Europe and Central Asia   Drug consumption is harmful to health, causing personality disorders that often lead to loss of will, apathy and the development of pathological behaviour  Furthermore, tens of thousands of people die every year as a direct result of drug consumption, while others, depending on the way these toxic substances are consumed, are affected by diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C   Today, illegal drug trafficking constitutes a global black market, a kind of underground or hidden economy for the growth, manufacture, distribution and sale of this merchandise in the form of marijuana, opium, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamines and other varieties of such substances and others  That market, which is ruled like any other by the laws of supply and demand, now amounts to the astronomical sum of approximately $billion a year  That astronomical sum means that the global drug trade is worth more than the gross domestic product of of the countries that appear on the annual World Bank economic index  Every year, the global drug market generates more wealth than countries such as Chile, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, Israel, South Africa and Portugal  But, at the same time, it is more economically powerful than many of the world’s leading petroleum producing countries such as Kuwait, Qatar, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela   In pursuit of its goals of conquering markets and accumulating wealth, transnational organized crime has begun availing itself of a new type of unprecedented, inhumane and cruel violence  Drug trafficking uses kidnapping, contract killings, torture and beheadings both in battles between drug trafficking groups and against the people and institutions that confront them  Drug trafficking sows fear and terror  It executes public servants as well as ordinary citizens  It murders journalists, teachers, doctors, students and housewives  Drug trafficking knows no limits or borders; it knows only horror, barbarism, bloodshed and crime   It is so powerful that it influences and interferes in vital areas of government, such as the armed forces, the police, intelligence services and the justice system, in its attempt to make State institutions serve its macabre and sinister interests       In the face of all of this, some people are right to wonder whether transnational organized crime and illegal international drug trafficking can be defeated  Is it really possible to tackle and defeat all that this form of international crime entails   Our response is: yes, it is possible  It is possible to take it on and to defeat it  It is possible to reduce it and to mitigate its harmful effects  However, to do so, several elements need to be in place  First, we need genuine commitment at the global level and authentic and genuine political will at the level of national Government   We also need a paradigm change or a new strategic vision that will focus our efforts to fight the problem, not only on the supply side, as has fundamentally been the case so far, but also on the demand and consumption side    It is imperative that we curb indiscriminate gun sales and human trafficking  We need to implement exchange and cooperation policies among the narcotics producer, transit and consumer countries  We need to introduce new technologies, strengthen intelligence systems, better train and enhance the professionalism of those in charge of ensuring public safety, design prevention mechanisms, generate educational opportunities, reduce poverty and create jobs, and get communities involved in building protective networks against crime   We hope that, in  when the General Assembly convenes its member States to evaluate the outcome of its new year Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem (see resolution , we will be in a position to say, for the sake of our families, our young people, our societies and, ultimately, of humanity as a whole, “We have prevailed  We have defeated the leading threat to the security our peoples at the beginning of the twentyfirst century  We have beaten drugs ”  It is important also to note that the human and material losses experienced as a result of natural disasters in are a great cause for concern  To date, we have seen floods and landslides, affecting countries as far apart as India and Brazil, China and Colombia, Russia and Congo, Kazakhstan and countries of East Africa, Mexico and Central America, Pakistan, Yemen and the Sudan   To date, there have been hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons, affecting countries such as Mexico, India, the Solomon Islands and Madagascar  To date, we have suffered eight serious droughts, followed by fires, in Bolivia, California, the Caribbean, China, Spain and Russia  To date, there have been seven earthquakes, from the tragedy in Haiti to China, from Tajikistan to Chile, and from Afghanistan to Mexico   That does not include the volcanic eruptions — these too made no distinction between rich and poor  In the case of Iceland, the volcano led to the most serious interruption of air traffic since the Second World War  In addition, we need to take into account the numerous cold snaps, avalanches and storms that have occurred and their resultant epidemics — foremost among them, cholera in Africa and dengue fever in Latin America and the Caribbean   As we can see, vulnerability to natural disasters around the world is on the rise, and development levels are falling quickly as a result  Most of these natural disasters are caused by climate change or global warming  It is therefore imperative that this world body adopt, as soon as possible, guidelines to regulate the emission of carbon dioxide and to protect the planet’s biodiversity   There is much work to be done around the world to draw up and adopt policies and practices that will enable us to prevent the impact of natural disasters  In this context, it is crucial to incorporate risk management into development and landuse planning  We need to design and implement early warning systems in coastal areas, cities at risk, schools and hospitals  And we need urgently to reequip critical infrastructure to ensure that it is adequate to withstand future catastrophes and to minimize human loss  Faced with this situation, the Dominican Republic intends to participate actively in the work of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, whose next meeting will take place in Geneva, Switzerland, in May   Likewise, with advisory assistance from the United Nations Development Programme and New York’s Columbia University, in October we will be meeting with the ministers responsible for social policy as well as the mayors of cities at greatest risk in order to review ongoing activities in the integration and planning of natural disaster risk management   Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to suggest, as we did during a visit to L’Aquila, Italy, that    the United Nations system create a world alliance of countries at risk in order to exchange experiences, knowledge and ideas, and to pass along best practices learned during catastrophes  We are convinced that this would be a major contribution to the design and implementation of measures that will help save lives and minimize material damage  I should like first to convey to you, Mr  President, the Dominican delegation warmest congratulations on your election as President of the thirteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly  The breadth of your culture, your long experience in the United Nations and your personal identification with the great causes under debate here, fully justify your election and are a guarantee that the course of our debates will be wisely directed Reaffirming its faith in the United Nations, the Dominican Republic takes part in the work of this thirteenth session of the General Assembly in order to combine its efforts with those of all States which are sincerely seeking, through the practice of the principles and methods advocated by the United Nations, the best solution to the urgent problems which are at present threatening the peace, security and wellbeing of the international community My Government firmly believes in the fundamental purpose of this Organization, to whose creation it contributed as a charter member of the great alliance formed on January  while the struggle was being waged on the battlefields of Europe and the Far East for those same principles of freedom and the independence of nations which are now being debated amid the anguish and dangers of the cold war In accordance with the guiding principles of Dominican foreign policy, the Dominican Government has pursued a course of staunch support for the United Nations  This is demonstrated by our collaboration in the Organization’s collective security programmes and, more particularly, in those which are inspired by a genuine sense of human solidarity, such as the programmes concerned with refugees, child relief and technical assistance, to which we have contributed with a generosity and regularity which have already become proverbial The interval between the twelfth and the thirteenth sessions of the General Assembly has been one of the most anxious times in the history of the United Nations, The expansionist forces of international communism, faced with the Western Powers' policy  of containment, have once again embarked upon a political manoeuvre comparable to the advance and withdrawal of the ocean waves and having the same effect of subterranean erosion, endangering as it does the defence of international peace and security We have witnessed an exchange of mutually recriminatory letters, which has vividly illustrated the clash between the two opposing points of view; charges have been brought without substantiation and the same subterfuges and sophistries have been brought out time and again, in the apparent belief that the nations witnessing this unedifying spectacle have short memories  This display of barren diplomatic exchanges is proof positive of the need to maintain the system of regional alliances provided for by the Charter at the highest level of effectiveness and unity of thought and action But what is the real significance of these associations for collective security  Alliances do not rest solely upon networks of bases and the mere interchange of material and equipment  It is essential to bear in mind the spiritual factors involved, for it is those factors which constitute the active principle holding them together  The word alliance signifies mutual respect, sincere friendship, a genuine readiness to afford mutual help and a deep understanding between the parties pledging their respective strength and resources The ideological conflict which developed in international relations during the period I have mentioned is not, however, confined to a sharp tactical contest on the diplomatic front  The wide disparities in economic development on the present international scene have given international communism a broad avenue for ideological and political penetration, and an opportunity for competition which is fraught with such implications for the future that concerted efforts of the widest and most vigorous kind are required to eliminate these disparities and to direct the fight against want, ignorance and disease along the only acceptable ideological lines, namely those defined at the beginning of Chapter IX of the Charter Economic and social cooperation may not be used as an instrument of political penetration or of intervention in the affairs of States  It must serve only the ends prescribed by the Charter, which stipulates that social progress and the raising of standards of living must conform to a more ample concept of freedom and that the creation of conditions of stability necessary for peaceful and friendly relations must be based on respect for the principle of equal rights and selfdetermination of peoples The vital need to mobilize resources of capital and technical knowledge and to secure steadily improved conditions for the international exchange of goods and services in order to better the social and economic situation of the underdeveloped countries is confronting the Americas with an extremely painful dilemma, which cannot go unheeded by American statesmen  Either we yield to the blandishments of those who seek to draw the American economy into the orbit of that economic policy which governed by tire principles of dialectical materialism and the class struggle transposed to the sphere of international relations, with all the unforeseeable consequences which a progressive trend in that direction might have, or we accept the challenge to establish in the Americas economic and social institutions of the kind required for the purposes of collective security against aggression and the peaceful settlement of international disputes,We share the conviction of those who believe that the historical community of the American nations has sufficient moral and material resources to develop in our continent, in accordance with our traditions based upon Western Christian philosophy, an outstanding example of international cooperation for the purposes of Chapter IX of the Charter We are faced, and this should be stressed again, with a real challenge to the future of interAmerican solidarity  Just as at the conferences of Havana in , Montevideo in and Buenos Aires in , we succeeded in overcoming the dangerous indecision which was vitiating continental policy towards certain practices incompatible with the principles of the independence and sovereignty of States, and again reaffirmed the principle of nonintervention; and just as, at the conferences at Petropolis in and at Bogota in  we established rules for collective security and the peaceful settlement of disputes which are an example to the rest of the world, it is now time for us to go beyond the stage of oratorical statements and of reservations inconsistent with the principles of economic and social cooperation which we claim to support, and to overcome the frustrations which attended the abortive Economic Agreement of Bogota, the meeting of Ministers of Finance in and the Economic Conference in Buenos Aires in  in order to set up a vigorous and effective system of economic and social cooperation The Dominican Republic shares to the full the anxieties which beset the American continent and which have placed the solution of the serious economic and social problems of the Americas in the forefront of public concern  The Dominican Republic, with a territory of square kilometres and a population of inhabitants, now offers, owing to the programme of political, social and economic rehabilitation introduced by Generalissimo Trujillo in  the spectacle of a nation which is achieving its rightful aspirations within the American community of nations Yet, twentyeight years ago the situation in the Dominican Republic offered one of the most depressing examples of economic and social underdevelopment  Our nation was plagued by internal upheavals which precluded any attempt at civilization and culture and threatened to place us outside the ranks of the civilized nations,During the early decades of this century, it became obvious that we must eliminate periods of social depression and embark upon a programme of national rehabilitation  We had to give force and meaning to our constitutional provisions which defined the Dominican Republic as a democratic and representative State, based upon the sovereignty of the people and on the fulfilment of certain essential human rights Up to our constitutional history was one of disharmony between the principles proclaimed by our institutions and the underlying economic and social facts  That being so, it was impossible for us to contribute in any way to international cooperation  The limits of our national territory were still undefined owing to the failure to solve the ageold frontier problem; our financial system had collapsed, bringing us to the verge of bankruptcy and anarchy; and our people were decimated by diseases which sapped their productive capacity and were deprived of the most elementary educational and cultural facilities, surviving precariously in a primitive economy  In those circumstances, it was clear that our Government, if it was to salvage the nation, was faced with the exceptional task of breathing life into the shadow of an almost vanished State and society Our territorial boundaries were fixed by the frontier agreement of and the gradual economic, social and cultural development brought about by the various Governments which have ruled the country under the same continuing political leadership has made possible such results as the following  In the country entire public health budget was no more than $ Today the budget of this important government service is some $ it has thus multiplied more than fifty times  Whereas in we had eight hospitals with beds, we now have fiftyone hospitals with beds, some of the hospitals having a greater capacity than all the hospitals in the country together in  The malaria eradication programme is reaching a decisive phase, with a marshalling of health resources never before seen in our history Our social policy protecting the working classes is reflected not only in our accession to the more important International Labour Organisation conventions but also in the incorporation of the standards laid down in these conventions in our own labour legislation  Our minimum wage regulations are at present being amended in accordance with a plan recommended by the United Nations Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance, the objective being to ensure that the level of wages of the lowerpaid working classes rises gradually in step with the expansion of the national economy and thus to preclude inflationary pressures or disturbances likely to make the continuous operation of undertakings uneconomic  Among the more important social security advances is legislation introducing compulsory life insurance for all civil servants and government employees earning less than $a month One interesting item in cur legislation for the protection of the needy classes is Act No   promulgated in  which provides for the payment of State allowances to the children of persons serving prison sentences, if they are without means of subsistence The Dominican Republic achievements in the sphere of education clearly demonstrate that government activities in our country are firmly rooted definitely and unquestionably in the people  In order to give a rough indication of the growth of education in the Republic in recent years I need only mention that, whereas the population has doubled in the last twentytwo years, primary schools have multiplied their capacity eleven times during the same period  Altogether, pupils are enrolled at schools in urban and rural areas; adolescents are attending secondary schools and are undergoing training in vocational schools, while young people are receiving higher education at our university  The most spectacular effort has been the Trujillo universal literacy campaign, whose effectiveness can be judged by the fact that whereas the illiteracy figure in was per cent, it has now fallen to per cent  There was, therefore, every justification for the statement made by Mr  Barón Castro, in addressing the third Latin American Education Congress at Ciudad Trujillo in January  on behalf of the Executive Board of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization that illiteracy had shown a lightning decline in the Dominican Republic  This year the Republic education budget will be more than $million, which is a higher figure than that of the country entire budget before the year The extent of the Republic economic progress can be estimated from its agricultural production and industrial development  As a result of the advances made in both these areas, the per caput income of the Republic has risen in from $to $ This result has been secured through an exceptional increase in the area under cultivation; national production for export, the value of which in did not exceed $million a year, in reached the highest figure in the country history — $million With regard to industry, as a result of the Government policy of stimulating development, there were, in  industrial establishments representing a total invested capital of more than $million  Economic development policy is based on the provision of absolute guarantees for domestic and foreign capital investments Great advances have been made in the electrification of the country since this source of power was nationalized  The Government has invested $million in the development of hydroelectricinstallations  Between and the country consumption of electricity rose to million kilowatthours, the increase in alone being kilowatts One of the Government largest undertakings at present, under the programme for the electrification of the entire country and for the improvement of the irrigation system, which has given such an impetus to agricultural development in the Republic, is the building of the Tavera dam which, when completed, will irrigate hectares and will have a capacity of million cubic metres of water  This project is being financed entirely by Dominican capital This mobilization of the country natural resources and manpower in  order to ensure a steady increase in the rate of economic and social development of the Dominican people is best reflected in the Dominican Government fiveyear plan, launched on August  which calls for the investment of some $million in economic development and in the expansion of health and educational services As the Dominican Republic economy is primarily an export economy, the rate of our economic development depends very largely on tire existence of favourable terms of trade  The Government of the Dominican Republic will cooperate to the utmost in the execution of plans already drawn up for the socalled Operation PanAmerican, but it considers that this programme should also provide for the elimination of certain restrictive agreements resulting in discrimination against the Dominican Republic most important export product in the United States market  My Government feels that there should be no permanent quota restrictions which discriminate against certain countries  This is a problem which affects not only the Dominican Republic but also the great majority of Latin American countries exporting agricultural and mineral raw materials; it is, therefore, a problem of general concern, and should be included in any programme designed to bring about a real interAmerican economic unity The delegation of the Dominican Republic earnestly hopes that the United Nations will not disappoint the hopes mankind has placed in it and that, during the present session, we shall be able to make a real and constructive contribution to the easing of international tension and come to realize — even those of us who see international relations as a dialectical process — that one of the most absurd contradictions and one which we all have an equal duty to seek to resolve is the paradox of a world becoming increasingly interdependent, yet at the same time driven by fears, antagonisms and rivalries absorbing energies which should rather be directed towards raising the general standard of living of all peoples  \\ufeffI wish to extend ourcongratulations to Mr  Jan Kavan on his election tolead the work of the General Assembly  We areconfident that his leadership will bring greater honourto the United Nations, to his country and to himself We would also like to congratulate his predecessor, Mr Han Seungsoo, for his excellent work during theprevious session We would also like to express our solidarity withSecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan in his defence of thewill of the many in the face of any event that placesworld peace at risk We also wish to welcome the SwissConfederation and East Timor as they take their placesin the Organization On behalf of the people and the Government ofthe Dominican Republic, I would like once again toreiterate the profound faith that the Dominican peoplehave in the principles on which the universal missionof the United Nations is based  The ideas andambitions that sparked the Second World War broughthumanity close to losing all hope for peaceful coexistence  Political fanaticism, intransigent nationalismand all sorts of prejudices cast their shadow overleaders and over a great part of the world, leading to anominous undertaking whose ideological manifestationgreatly endangered the freedom and cultural diversityof humankind Luckily for all, reason prevailed  In order to makethat victory a lasting one, and in order to ensure thathumankind would maintain a steady and clear pathtowards peace, the nations who fought for freedomrecognized the need to create a body to watch over thevalues that would improve international behaviour These were the reasons for both the emergence of theUnited Nations and for enshrining in the Charter theobjectives of peace, justice, the rejection of aggressionand the resolution of controversies through peacefulmeans and in accordance with international law In other words, it was very clearly set out that theOrganization would seek to use every peaceful meansto resolve conflicts between peoples or States  It wasalso clearly specified that the use of force to maintainor restore peace and international security had to be theresult of a unanimous decision of the permanentmembers of the Security Council  Over five decadeshave passed since the establishment of theOrganization, and the events and changes experiencedby the world in that time have been innumerable Many bloody conflicts in the Middle East, Asiaand Africa have challenged the authority of the UnitedNations  Many unilateral actions have violated theOrganization legal system and threatened the balanceof the world  Nevertheless, despite every provocationand all the instances of noncompliance with theresolutions of its highest bodies, the Organization hasclearly made its mark by asserting the need to respectthe international norms and laws governing thebehaviour of its members  Peace, and even the survivalof mankind itself, owe a great deal to the achievementsof the United Nations Unfortunately, threats to universal peace continueto cast their shadow over the world today  The date ofSeptember is an alarming example of thescope and capability of the enemies of peace  We willnever be able to forget the perversity of those actions,their criminal character or the affront they tried toinflict upon this great nation  We understand perfectlywell that, in the face of an aggression of this nature, thespontaneous reaction may be that of claiminglegitimate selfdefence  However, we should agree thatsuch a response has moral limitations and conditionsembodied in the principles that rule the rights of peopleand in those that form the bedrock of this Organization The Dominican Government has been signing allresolutions, agreements and conventions againstterrorism  The Dominican Government has supportedSecurity Council resolution (, which createdthe CounterTerrorism Committee, and is promotingthe work to draft a comprehensive convention againstinternational terrorism  However, our purpose infighting this scourge and our solidarity with the nationsthat have been and are its victims must be focused,beyond any contingency, on the eradication of thecauses that stimulate and provoke the depravation ofthe human condition that is expressed in acts of terror With regard to the right to confront terrorismdirectly, we must be aware that unilateral actionrepresents a defeat of our capacity to reach agreements It is only logical that it is our responsibility to do sowith all the authority that this Organization grantsthrough its multilateral nature  This is true because theuse of force can be justified only when all means underthe Charter of United Nations available to the GeneralAssembly and the Security Council to assess the existenceof a real threat to world peace have been exhausted In his report of April concerning theissue of peace in Africa, the SecretaryGeneral set forthideas which must serve as a guide on the Iraqisituation  Among other ideas, Kofi Annan stated:“For the United Nations there is no highergoal, no deeper commitment and no greaterambition than preventing armed conflict  Theprevention of conflict begins and ends with thepromotion of human security and humandevelopment ” (A/ para  It is obvious that we are not the only ones to thinkthat, in the face of market globalization processes, culturalexchanges, technologies and communications, it hasbecome imperative to resume on the path laid down atthe Millennium Summit in order to correct the imbalancesand to halt the growing total marginalization of largesectors of the world population  Allow me to quote aparagraph from the Millennium Declaration as areminder of our priorities:“We believe that the central challenge weface today is to ensure that globalization becomesa positive force for all the world people  Forwhile globalization offers great opportunities, atpresent its benefits are very unevenly shared,while its costs are unevenly distributed  Werecognize that developing countries and countrieswith economies in transition face specialdifficulties in responding to this centralchallenge ” (resolution  para  Moreover, the Millennium Summit prioritizedissues such as poverty, illiteracy, illness, genderinequality and environmental depletion as causes thatconspire decisively against peace and universalcoexistence  These troubling situations beg thequestion: How much have we done at the national andinternational levels to eliminate the obstacles thathinder the growth of the developing countries Right from its assumption of power in August the Government of the Dominican Republic,headed by agronomist Hipólito Mej'a, has taken aseries of measures aimed at adapting legislation in bothpublic and private institutions to the demands of theunavoidable globalization process  With respect tosocial reform, the Dominican Government haslaunched a programme to reduce poverty and hasincreased its support in the fight against illiteracy  Thecreation of ministries of women and the environmentare also significant initiatives in view of the lack ofattention from which these sectors of societytraditionally suffered We know that other countries have made similarchanges, but the truth of the matter is that, as a whole,global statistics leave little room for optimism whencompared to those relating to the great majority ofdeveloping countries  Unfortunately, at the globallevel, we cannot say that developed countries havemanifested any understanding of or solidarity towardsthese issues in positive terms  The opportunitiesoffered by the developed countries for developingcountries to participate in the globalization processthrough cooperation leading to harmonious, gradualand equitable adaptation leave much to be desired Within this sombre picture, the United Nations hasto act decisively in favour of the development of nationsunjustifiably constrained by protectionism and subsidies,which create barriers that hinder competition on equalterms and which, consequently, negate free trade Year after year, speaker after speaker, we speak inthis solemn Hall about the mandate — also ratified atthe Millennium Summit — to proceed with decisivereforms in the Security Council and the GeneralAssembly  However, a sort of indifference or adversepurport postpones or paralyses the opportunity toactually undertake such reform  If the universalconscience is to enjoy genuine representation, thereform of such bodies is imperative  Thus, thisOrganization needs its multilateral role to become thetrue expression of the political composition acquiredby the world over the past years On behalf of the Dominican Government, wewish to express our satisfaction for the decision takenby the Organization of American States regardingHaiti  Indeed, through its resolution of 4September  entitled “Support for strengtheningdemocracy in Haiti”, that regional organization decidedto support the regularization of economic cooperationbetween the Haitian Government and internationalfinancial institutions  Following the instructions of thePresident of the Dominican Republic, we appeal to theconscience of the United Nations to proceed in thesame manner and to extend its support in reachingthose nations capable of generous cooperation with oursister nation I wish to take this opportunity to share the mostrecent decisions concerning the International Researchand Training Institute for the Advancement of Women,headquartered in the Dominican Republic, which is one ofthe few United Nations bodies located in a developingcountry and the only one working on women researchand training  On December  by resolution the General Assembly decided to create aworking group with the mandate to makerecommendations on the future work of the Institute  Thatworking group met eight times in July and August The Dominican Republic is confident that this sessionof the General Assembly will accept the workinggroup recommendations and that the Institute willsoon be able to continue to fulfil its mandate In conclusion, I must recall that, at the beginningof my statement, I reaffirmed the faith of the Dominicanpeople and Government in the mission of the UnitedNations  This Organization is more necessary today thanever before, at a time when the world is shrinking andwhen we increasingly need more than one interlocutorto which we can turn when faced with issues that couldprovoke violence and war  In other words, today morethan ever all nations aspire to having an Organizationthat, through its traditional mandate and its universalscope, can strike a balance among all States for thebenefit of genuine democratic security  I am honoured to address the General Assembly on behalf of the people and the Government of the Dominican Republic  At the outset, I would like to apologize on behalf of Mr  Danilo Madina Sánchez, President of the Dominican Republic, for his absence from the debate, as he has had to return to our country to deal with Hurricane Maria Our meeting this week coincides with the devastating season of natural disasters that our region has been enduring for nearly a month with terrible consequences  The disasters have also spread to Mexico, which has been hit by two destructive earthquakes, and the southern United States, viciously punished by Hurricane Harvey  In the catalogue of human suffering caused by Hurricane Irma, that of Antigua and Barbuda stands out, particularly Barbuda, per cent of whose infrastructure has collapsed, according to its Prime Minister, Gaston Browne  Hardly had Irma’s devastating winds dropped than Maria arrived, leaving a new trail of destruction and death, inflicting a direct hit first on Dominica and today on its neighbour Puerto Rico, causing great destruction and damage We take this opportunity to express our solidarity with Puerto Rico, which is also our neighbour, as well as with all the countries affected  The people of the Dominican Republic offer their deepest sympathy for the destruction and the large numbers of victims  Accurate figures for the damage done on Saint Barthélemy, Saint Maarten, Anguilla, the Virgin Islands, Tortola, Turks and Caicos, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and especially Florida and Cuba, have yet to be determined  However, we can say that they have suffered substantial damage, that recovery will take years and that, tragically, valuable lives have been lost To give Member States an idea of how severely we have been affected, despite the lack of definitive figures, I can say that the material losses caused by this hurricane season alone far exceed the gross domestic product of the Dominican Republic  We often focus on material damage and ignore the human suffering caused by such disasters, whose lethal power has been aggravated by climate change  The statistics are striking, but they cannot reflect the pain of the victims, their desolation at seeing so much work ruined and so many efforts, visions and dreams lost  It is not just houses that have been lost, it is homes  Material damage has been done, but above all, lives have been shattered We must recognize the inherent dangers of climate change, which are far more significant in the context of the geography of the Caribbean  Our economies, our way of life and our potential for development are in jeopardy  The vulnerability of the Caribbean and of the Dominican Republic poses a risk that we cannot face alone  While our country was fortunate enough not to suffer human losses during the recent passage of Hurricane Irma, we are aware that, like every Caribbean island, we will always be vulnerable to this type of phenomenon That reality impels us to once again draw the Assembly’s attention to the crucial importance of joining forces to confront such threats  It compels us to act in a responsible and united way to defend the lives of our people  And I would like to be extremely clear on this point  The messages of solidarity and the humanitarian aid that always follow such disasters are not enough  Nor is it enough to sign agreements on climate change  There is an urgent and critical need to act coherently on those agreements in order to advance a united agenda and set concrete plans in motion We are facing a growing problem that knows no borders and requires the cooperation and solidarity of all of us, but especially the most developed and most powerful countries  We are facing a reality that will oblige us to act as responsibly as we can if we do not want to go on lamenting the consequences  That is why my country is once again proposing to the Assembly that we create a special fund for dealing with this type of disaster and for prevention and early warning, which will help us save lives  If we want to see an example of how economic resources can help to mitigate the damage done by natural phenomena, we need only look at the United States  After the most recent hurricanes, its Government, which has the necessary resources, immediately made $billion available for rebuilding its affected states, thereby providing its citizens with the help they needed  Conversely, there is no way that vulnerable areas such as the island region of the Caribbean can cope with the devastation that such phenomena inflict on our peoples and countries As an example, take my own country, the Dominican Republic  This year, natural phenomena in the form of rains and floods have damaged thousands of kilometres of highways and roads, resulting in substantial losses  Dozens of bridges have collapsed and miles of retaining walls and irrigation canals have been destroyed  Thousands of acres of mixed farmland that are vital to keeping our people fed every day have been lost  In addition, among much other damage, hundreds of homes have been destroyed, not counting those hit by Hurricane Irma  We have spent more than $million on rescue and relief operations just in the past few months We are therefore concerned about the fact that similar, or even more powerful, events resulting from climate change have the potential to set the development of ours and other Caribbean countries back years  I am talking about snatching away a whole people’s happiness and prospects for the future  That is not something we can continue to take lightly  It is in that context that the work of the United Nations and the solidarity between our countries make most sense On behalf of all the men, women, children and elderly people who are utterly desperate right now, I urge all of us to seek ways for the United Nations to support Governments that cannot cope on their own in rebuilding their countries in the wake of natural disasters  Let us take the necessary steps to make that aid available and ensure that it reaches those in desperate need  It is part of our responsibility as brother nations  I would also like to call on the countries of the United Nations to reflect anew, and urgently, on what we must do in order to counteract extreme climate events  The scientific evidence for the relationship between natural disasters, manmade change and global warming is quite sufficient  It is time for us to play our part and act to slow down events, or the future will judge us for our total lack of responsibility Since the Organization was founded, years ago, our country has been a member of the unique experience in the history of humankind that is its creation  Since then, the United Nations has been a beacon pointing the way to a future of hope  We must never fall into complacency on that road  We know that essential aspects of our civilization, such as peace, security and development, are not gifts that drop from the sky  They are not something that we can take for granted  They are the result of a commitment between our peoples that must be constantly renewed and that we must keep working for  The Dominican Republic is fully committed to that vision and to the search for comprehensive solutions to the challenges facing the international community  We are determined to contribute energetically to building an evermore democratic, participatory and effective United Nations to help solve our peoples’ real problems  Mr  President, it was a source of great pleasure for me to see you elected to preside over the twentyfifth session of the General Assembly at a time when our Organization has recorded in the pages of history the twentyfifth anniversary of its founding in San Francisco when it was set up to guide the destiny of the peoples Members of the Organization and serve as a repository for the principles for the maintenance and preservation of the peace and progress that our civilization demands The election which has led to your being chosen to preside over this Assembly a very wise choice indeed is a tribute to your great country, which has contributed to the development of the history of free nations a tradition of peace that serves as an example for the legal community that we constitute a country which has always commanded respect and admiration from all corners of the earth  Your election is also a tribute of recognition and respect rendered to your wisdom, your qualities as a statesman and your devotion to the cause defended by the nations assembled in this world Organization  Under your enlightened and experienced guidance we are sure that the Assembly will embark upon a session which in and of itself is of great importance because of the tremendous tasks confronting all delegations, the significance of the anniversary that is coming up shortly and because here, as never before, a spirit of understanding and coexistence should prevail above all momentary considerations so that we may inaugurate a new phase in international law under the most auspicious circumstances  We are duty bound to display this spirit because of the wisdom, the experience and the maturity which we have gained during twentyfour regular sessions of the General Assembly, sessions which have led us to the point where we will be commemorating this exceptional event very shortly in solemn ceremony and celebration It is, therefore, an honor for my delegation to convey to you our good wishes on your election and we are sure that your wisdom will enlighten and guide our thinking and our decisions during the discharge of the mandate that we have received from our respective Governments During the holding of the twentyfourth regular session of the General Assembly the Dominican Republic, in a desire to contribute in some way to the historic importance of the session upon which we are just embarking, conveyed to the SecretaryGeneral an expression of our desire that as part of the methodology of the specific question of a new reform of the United Nations Charter we should include consideration of the right of veto in the Security Council and the Powers enjoying that right, the apolitical status of outer space and the right of new small States to be admitted to the world Organization twentyfive years after the founding of the United Nations we cannot fail to recognize the changes that have occurred in the world of today in all essential aspects and, most particularly, with respect to international life upon the emergence of new States, all of which makes it incumbent upon us to find new formulae to bring the constituent principles of the Organization up to date taking into account the experience gained over a quarter of a century and the ideals that justify its existence We all recall very clearly the debates that developed in connexion with Article of the Charter of the United Nations  I refer to the right of veto which was accepted finally in the form in which it now appears in the Charter We must recognize the fact that after the last World War and mankind is still suffering its residual effects statesmen wanted to lay unshakable foundations for the maintenance and preservation of peace in the world but none the less, the spirit of war had an impact on the solutions involving the interests of the victorious States  That situation was most typical among the great Powers  I venture to believe that that cause and no other, taken together with a need to find a substitute for the classical system of alliances to maintain international equilibrium, predominated in the deliberations that finally led to the provision of the veto in the Security Council There seems no doubt that to a considerable degree the veto has fulfilled the objective for which it was created, despite the frequent exercise of this right by the States that possess the veto  But the facts tend to show that if on some occasions this tool has proved useful to avoid greater evils, it is equally certain that in other instances the frequency with which this exceptional right has been exercised, a right which is discriminatory in the light of the principles of democracy, has come to constitute an obstacle to the progress that the United Nations should have attained in achieving the purposes for which it was set up This modem age, with the present stage of development of space science and the achievements of man through his journeys to the moon, has created a new individual and collective mentality, and we should admit this now  The States that make up our Organization are not immune to the impact of this new mentality However, we cannot deny that man is just as imperfect as he was on the first day of his creation, but it is obvious that, like civilizations, generations move and are transformed in accordance with the immutable laws of human progress For this reason the fundamental instrument which governs us cannot have failed to feel the impact of these uncontrollable pressures  Hence we find the reason justifying the need for reforms of the principles which, until the past decade, and particularly if we look back twentyfive years, were appropriate to mitigate the imperfections of international life and the conflicts that it has been possible to confine to certain areas of the world without allowing these conflicts to involve the Members of the Organization in a new total warlike adventure where the last word would be had by those who had predominance in nuclear weapons that are capable of wiping out every vestige of human life and civilization from the face of the earth Accordingly, on the occasion of this important Assembly, concern about the veto has cropped up once again  It might be said that recently an awareness of the veto has been developed that has come to be expressed by certain radical manifestations, as in 'he  case of Brazil which has set forth the criterion that the veto should be prohibited if we wish to preserve the United Nations from the decadence likely to lead to its final dissolution Our country initiative would constitute a step forward in this direction  It pays tribute to the law of nature that does not proceed by leaps and bounds, and at the same time it is in accordance with the proven experience that the life of nations and of men develops in accordance with a process of evolution that cannot nor should not be violated, subject to the penalty of retreating in a move backward to previous positions or a position marking a step even further back For that reason we are advocating a solution which moves between the enshrinement of the division of the veto with the feature of one veto for two votes or for the adoption of a quota of vetoes  If circumstances would permit, this would be the position we would take if we agreed to revise the Charter The legal rules that constitute the body of law governing outer space would be incomplete if they did not rest upon a fundamental rule drawn from the notion of the apolitical status of space, the area in which those rules should be applied and respected  We are dealing here with such a new and sensitive international contribution as the idea of jurisprudence to apply to outer space  In this exceedingly new field we shall certainly have to grapple with great difficulties, periods of stagnation and experiences, and we will have to exercise the utmost wisdom in coping with this task  In the light of the strictest provisions of the Charter it will also be essential to think above all of the survival of the human race in the face of the dangers inherent in the conquest of the vast reaches of the stars With these concerns in mind, and convinced as we are that the progress of technology in respect of the conquest of outer space is proceeding at a dizzy pace, we have sketched out our concern which might seem a bit sudden if it were not for the fact that we are already confronted with inescapable facts and realities in referring as we have to the fact that outer space should be considered as apolitical in this twenty fifth session of the General Assembly  We have made these comments because we are desirous of contributing by this expression of our goodwill to the celebration of a quarter of a century of the United Nations The advent of new, smaller States to independent international life has been the subject of speculation and informal public statements which may perhaps have created a degree of confusion in certain international quarters, and even prejudices that can mislead the public conscience  The reaction that has been produced, as was logical to assume, has sometimes led to the possibility of people thinking somewhat lightly of how far we can go in weakening the legal equality of States by a system of restrictions If this idea were to gain a little more currency, it would foster various prejudices harmful to our Organization and could eventually perhaps in some way undermine people confidence in the raison d'etre of this Organization, an organization that we should defend firmly against all obstacles that may to a greater or lesser degree affect its necessary development in the interest of maintaining the legal order free from discrimination of any kind Obviously, we should foresee events and prevent the abnormalities that may affect our Organization  In that manner we will preserve the legacy of experience that we, the peoples that make up this Organization, have garnered here after two and a half decades of what has often been stormy activity which an organization which has met the tests to which it has been subjected up until this great moment in history Accordingly, it would be appropriate for us to look forward to the situation that may arise in connexion with the admission of new smaller States  We believe that, with this approach, we can find workable solutions, so that when we come to deal with a problematical or contentious case, we can find the way out which will meet the facts of the case, without destroying the principle of the legal equality of States My delegation has always supported the principles of political decolonization and the right to self determination of peoples, which have been given concrete expression under the aegis of the United Nations  We have kept this position and we shall continue to do so, convinced as we are that this provision contained in the constitution of this Organization is in accordance with the most appropriate procedure for forming the national conscience of the people so favored, and to ensure that the transitional period towards the highest degree of selfgovernment can achieve at least a minimum level of efficiency, in order that it may enjoy lasting status within the international legal community But, together with political decolonization, we would also like to see, concomitantly, the idea of economic decolonization, which is possible only if the States Members of our Organization share the idea of economic interdependence, which is becoming more and more pressing for the same reasons for which we pay homage in this world of today to the principle of the interdependence of States  We should strengthen this edifice without it being necessary to distinguish between dissimilarities of population, territory, or social, economic, cultural or political development, which reflect the characteristic features and peculiarities of these States, and we should increasingly make progress in this idea of international economic interdependence We have maintained this line of approach and we will continue to maintain it in the Economic and Social Council and in all the subsidiary bodies which are entrusted with the heavy responsibility of fostering the progress of peoples through modern methods  Many barriers of prejudices and archaic conventional attitudes will still have to be overthrown  In this task which confronts the States Members of the Organization, the Dominican Republic has steadily opted in favor of the adoption of new formula and rules which can lead us to solutions that will eradicate the pressures and international tensions that allow us no respite In recent years the Dominican Republic has advocated a formula to put an end to the conflict in the Middle East in accordance with methods for the solution of situations of this kind  We are concerned about the state of stagnation in which this effort for peace has been bogged down; yet the effectiveness of this effort is the responsibility not only of all free peoples of the world but also of the Organization itself The renewal of the mandate entrusted by the SecretaryGeneral to his Special Representative, Ambassador Jarring, has not only helped to reaffirm our faith in the instruments available to us to restore peace where it has been breached, but it has also served to lessen considerable international tensions considerably and it has strengthened the hope that, finally, it will be possible to come to terms acceptable to the parties involved We understand that the road ahead will be subject to certain alternate choices which are characteristic of international life, but we see looming up the end of the task that we have undertaken to reach the peace agreement that we all long for The situation that has affected VietNam for a number of years has always been a source of concern to my country, which has cooperated as fully as possible and which in every instance has offered proper support in the difficult task of preserving the peace This is the policy that a small country such as ours would never wish to depart from at any time  We are proud of being a founding Member of this community of nations, which is the greatest that has ever existed since the origin of mankind We must feel gratified when we see that the United States of America has been withdrawing sizable contingents of troops from the center of military operations in that area and that the central Government has shown that it will continue to withdraw these troops in accordance with the statements made by President Nixon  It is highly significant that this fact should have occurred precisely when we were entering upon the twentyfifth regular session of the General Assembly of the world Organization, with new prospects opening up for the future of the States Members of this Organization We sincerely believe that we are on the verge of witnessing the departure from VietNamese territory of the last United States troops in accordance with the timetable worked out  It is very comforting to see that after the stagnation in the efforts to reduce nuclear weapons that were being accumulated at a terrifying dramatic pace, we can now say that progress has been made, which my delegation cannot overlook In all sincerity I believe that this is perhaps the most important item for those of us who are participating in this General Assembly, and we would hope that the Assembly will emerge from this session fortified with all its constructive potential  This would serve as a kind of lever of Archimedes, which is the will of all peoples on this commemorative anniversary to mark the dawn of a new era in the world in which good understanding will prevail designed to achieve the goal we have set ourselves in the face of the dilemma with which the unbridled arms race confronts us a race into which we have been impelled by lack of confidence and by our blind attitude towards the danger that hangs over us In behalf of the Government I represent, may I be permitted to pay a tribute of gratitude for this important development which has allayed the unrest and tensions to which we have been subjected for so many years We should also take into account the efforts made to come to an agreement on a treaty to prohibit the emplacement of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction on the seabed, the ocean floor and in the subsoil thereof, which in truth would constitute an effective step towards the conclusion of the treaty on general and complete disarmament which is so anxiously awaited In addition, for the same reasons, we would praise the action that has been undertaken to halt the development of chemical and bacteriological means of warfare and also arduous efforts under way to ensure that such weapons are prohibited from the arsenals of nations It is disturbing to note that the production of such means of destruction should have marked a considerable step backwards in international thinking on war despite the Geneva Protocol of which prohibits the use of this type of weapon  And that reversion to a position we had left behind long age under the influence of the lofty principles of humanity and should have created a situation in which the General Assembly finds it necessary to call upon States to fulfil the principles of that important Protocol Accordingly, it would be well for us to come to an agreement which not only guarantees observance of the prohibition in Platonic terms but also provides for the verification of compliance with this Protocol  Without the latter measure, which has already received the support of some Members of the Organization, we shall not be able to achieve chemical and bacteriological disarmament and thus safeguard mankind from weapons that are as inhuman as nuclear weapons themselves Every effort that is made to arrive at reasonable disarmament and to avoid the overflow of these vast arsenals, which are a source of concern to us, will command the vigorous support of the Dominican Republic  We therefore viewed certain relaxations of tension which have been brought about in Geneva in the field of disarmament as a promising omen that will increase the confidence of peaceloving peoples Since the United Nations has been able to survive all the tests to which it has been subjected so far, this argument alone would suffice to justify the efforts we should exert to ensure that it continues to achieve the objectives for which it was created, at a decisive moment when the scourge of war had imperiled all of modern civilization True, there has been much criticism of the United Nations  We must confess that much of this criticism is justified, but we cannot deny that most of it is exaggerated or not really justified if we examine the criticism objectively No matter how strict we may be, we cannot deny its positive achievements which have proved to be milestones in history  This criterion allows us to take into consideration the fact that we have tried to create a perfect Organization in a world in which mankind handiwork always suffers from imperfections However that may be, under the sheltering umbrella of the principles of the Charter we have been able to demonstrate how useful dialog is at the high level of this Organization  We thus arrive at the affirmation that it is difficult to negotiate when we hear the cannons roar It is understandable that despite the complexities of international life some would like to see the United Nations take more dynamic action, and more willingness to comply with its resolutions  I venture to surmise that this is due largely to the sensibilities involved and the magnitude of the interests often in conflict  But that does not mean that we should not foster the idea of a fresh endeavor and for this it will probably be necessary to bring the Charter up to date so that it will reflect the changes that have occurred and will continue to occur in our time While it is obvious that the principles of the United Nations are influential even as they are now structured, we would hope that its legal and moral authority will be exercised with greater efficiency when they have been revised and have had time to acquire their full strength and vigor I should now like to make a comment concerning the record of the tremendous accomplishments of the United Nations during the years of its existence and say that my delegation would venture to suggest that if the Organization has not been very effective, as its critics allege, that is in large measure the fault of ourselves, the Member States, because in fact we have not given the Organization all the support and effective collaboration needed to uphold those principles and resolutions which have not been applied or have been applied imperfectly or very tardily During the twentyfourth session of the General Assembly my Government had the opportunity to state its interest in the idea that the Assembly should provide favorable conditions for a firm step towards agreement on a system for international security \\u2003 At that time my delegation said, and I reaffirm it now, that the mobilization of wills towards an achievement of this kind for the world would be the best contribution we could make to the celebrations marking the twentyfifth anniversary of the United Nations  It would also be the greatest tribute we could pay on this happy occasion to all who have been the victims of war    It is my privilege to conveythe warmest congratulations of the Government r d delegation of the Dominican Republic, and my own personal congratulations, to Mr  Ismat T  Kittani on his fitting election to the presidency of the thirtysixth session of the General Assembly, which election augers well for our discussions I should like at the same time to express my admiration for Mr  Rudiger von Wechmar outstanding, correct and vigorous direction of the session just ended The delegation of the Dominican Republic, on behalf of its Government and people, extends its condolences to the family of President Anwar El Sadat and to the people and Government of the Republic of Egypt on the tragic death of their head of State, who was one of the pillars upholding peace in the Middle East and in the world today  His death moves us to the most profound thoughts, both in the very heart of the United Nations and in the States that constitute the international community A/PV It is a great pleasure to extend a very cordial and friendly welcome to the new Member States that have joined the Organization  We are sure that Vanuatu and Belize will, by their spirit of collaboration and their identification with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, contribute to the achievement of the objectives that fortunately led to its birth in San Francisco in  permitting the world to enter a new era of peace after the devastation of the last world war Allow me, as Secretary of State for External Relations of the Dominican Republic, to endorse before the General Assembly these words which justify the existence of the United Nations: Peace is the foundation of international order and the most effective instrument of human progress The situations of conflict we are facing in this period of history illustrate, from every point of view, the sentence I have just quoted  We are living in the nuclear age; we are living through a crisis of law and the proliferation of the most destructive weapons ever conceived  Only with a spirit of good will, cooperation and solidarity will the States Members of the Organization succeed in finding the formulas that are urgently needed for achieving peace The task is undoubtedly a difficult and why not say it  ominous one, as the panorama of international politics becomes increasingly complex  Nevertheless, we believe that peace is not impossible when human beings are confronted with a dilemma that has become a challenge to their very survival The Dominican Republic, a small country, has struggled vigorously for the rule of freedom and peace in the world, and it is striving increasingly to conduct its international relations in accordance with the standards established in the founding instrument of the world Organization and in the light of the principles of international law Many years passed before the reality of what the Caribbean represents for this part of the world was taken into account and assessed in the context of the hemisphere  Colonial history reveals that the surrounding ocean was a closed and mysterious place that served as a setting for pirates, buccaneers and freebooters  The history of the island of Tortuga is a murky drama, as described by one of the most respected historians and jurists of the Dominican Republic  This island, located in the path of the hurricanes, is still a reminder of an age of intrigue and death No analysis is needed to state that the insularity of the Caribbean area is a fragmented one  It produces characteristic sociological phenomena that have not been advantageous to our harmonious and lasting union  The Dominican Republic enjoys the privilege of being probably the first country to point out that, because of its very nature and geographical situation, insularity should lead to thinking on a regional scale because of mutual interests and the new perspectives now opening up in the world Thus, this idea, which had become rooted in the nation political thinking, began to take concrete shape during the official visit made to my country by the Minister for External Relations of Costa Rica in  A novel and realistic conception of the greater Caribbean area came into being, based on linking all the independent countries whose territories are washed by those waters The work being done to make the Caribbean Basin initiative an immediate reality is most encouraging  This initiative originated with the group sponsored by the United States, and its participants now include the United States, Canada, Mexico and Venezuela  Thus the countries of the region now facing the direct impact of the crisis affecting the international economy could rely on financial resources to meet the challenge of their development The Caribbean Basin initiative began to take practical shape after the Nassau meeting of the foreign ministers of those four nations in July of this year  The countries of the area are actively working to make its program of action an immediate reality, for the dismal future looming ahead of us does not permit delay We are aware that private investment will play a large role in this program  It must be recognized, however, that several factors will prevent these investments from producing good results in the short term  The hesitancy to commit capital, the lack of energy sources and, in some cases, of the indispensable infrastructure and the high interest rates prevailing in financial markets can constitute discouraging factors for potential private investors  We therefore feel that, in view of the pressing economic situation facing our countries, the program must give priority to official assistance* both financial and through the adoption of measures to eliminate the barriers that affect our countries' exports ' For the Dominican Republic, whose main export product is sugar, it is a matter for grave concern that various countries that import this staple food are taking measures that have very negative repercussions on selling prices  Reconsideration of those measures, which have such a serious effect not only on the Dominican Republic but on other countries as well, would be an effective and helpful measure of cooperation to be taken by the countries that have adopted them I would like to say how pleased the Government of the Dominican Republic was to allow the city of Santo Domingo to host the important meetings on the Caribbean Basin initiative  These meetings, which are being held this very week, will assemble representatives from the Caribbean countries, Central America and the group sponsored by the United States We should like to make special mention in this world forum of the valuable economic cooperation we are receiving from the countries of the region in the context of the Energy Cooperation Program for Central American and Caribbean Countries, concluded at San Jose on August by the Presidents of Mexico and Venezuela, the main suppliers of the oil we consume, under which Mexico and Venezuela are financing part of our oil bill  These funds will be used for development projects We have become convinced that human rights and terrorism are separate subjects and that each must be considered individually  We cannot avoid recognizing the fact that under many circumstances there is an obvious connection between them In the battle against violation of human rights, the authorities whose task it is to maintain public order have often exceeded the limits established by law  I am referring to a situation in which, in the context of its activity to contain the spreading tide of terrorism, legitimate authority exceeds its jurisdiction and expands its activity to a point where it can be termed a violation of the law  This gives rise to the idea that the concept of State terrorism must be added to that of terrorism pure and simple  Abuse of power, which is also a criminal offense, cannot be allowed to reinforce legitimate prosecution  To exceed those limits constitutes a violation of human rights by the authority acting to prevent this type of violation In this context, we should like to mention the proposal made by the Federal Republic of Germany to contribute to a decision aimed at embodying respect for human rights in more concrete form  It is paradoxical that on the one hand physical integrity is considered an inalienable right within the general structure of human rights while on the other hand there is no provision barring the death penalty In this period typified by a demand for human rights there is one unacceptable note of discord: namely, the fact that in some countries a punishment reminiscent of the lex talionis is still in effect  The right to punish implies the obligation to regenerate and rehabilitate the individual who committed the offense  Changes in criminological thinking are considerable, and the abandonment of outmoded and barbaric ideas is being advocated  The continued entrusting to the State of the destruction of human beings by human beings, therefore, seems unjustifiable At the thirtyfifth session my delegation spoke about this situation [h meeting, paras  , which in our opinion is an anomaly  At that time we noted that the American Convention on Human Rights' prohibits capital punishment on the one hand while on the other hand tolerating it in those States where it existed prior to the signing of the Convention  The substantive law of the Dominican Republic prohibits capital punishment, and when we signed the Convention we expressed the hope that in the future this anomaly would be eliminated from that interAmerican instrument governing human rights Since the first outbreaks of terrorism in the second half of this century the Dominican Republic has supported the principle that terrorism is a violation of common law and accordingly that classifying it as such may be the key to limiting the incidence of international crime  Classification of it as a political crime hinders punishment under the legal system for many acts which then cease to be the subject of the public rejection that justifies the existence of public order  It also elevates the most loathsome transgressions to the status of heroic deeds In those cases classification as political crimes encourages protection through asylum and thwarts extradition  In this situation, we recommend that the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism review these arguments thoroughly and include in its study a specific analysis to determine the applicability of triple classification of political crimes according to their nature, their motives and the association of the political crime with a common law crime  This has enjoyed a certain acceptance among those who propound the tripartite idea of the political crime and suggests that classifying terrorism as a crime against the law of nations, with all its consequences, might ultimately prove to be the radical formula that could at last reduce the uncontrolled spread of terrorism We believe that the States Members of the United Nations are persuaded that terrorism could lead to a state of anarchy, since it shows every sign of increasing rather than diminishing  The victims of this grave social and political outrage are generally innocent persons while the perpetrators suffer nO risks, as in the case of the taking of hostages, the seizing of aircraft with their passengers and many other forms of terrorism, which must be condemned by joint action Among the acts of terrorism which have shocked the world this year and which point to a kind of return to barbarism are the assassination attempts made on President Ronald Reagan and on the Holy Father, Pope John Paul n  They occurred before the echoes or the condemnation by all civilized nations of the taking of postages at the American Embassy at Teheran and at the Dominican Republic Embassy at Bogota had died down  It could be said that the sacrilegious hand of evil was raised as proof of the unwillingness to search for legal methods and effective formulas to halt the wave of international terrorism Let us think also of the dramatic death of President Anwar El Sadat  Terrorism is indeed the most odious form of crime My delegation wishes to mention at this point the appeal now being made by the Organization for the fostering of goodneighborly relations in the interest of maintaining international peace and security  It is certainly the aim of this proposal to lead to better understanding and harmony among nations, with the consequent reduction of international tensions, and to provide support in preventing disputes and conflicts Within the context of this idea of goodneighborliness, the Dominican delegation has submitted a plan [ibid , paras   based on the relations between the Governments of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which share sovereignty over the second largest island in the Antilles archipelago  The results flow not only from that premise but also from one that we consider more specific, that of permanent good will between peoples and Governments  That statement transcends the principle of the interAmerican legal system  To make it doctrinally more attractive and more viable, the idea of a method of action has been embodied in the promising and dynamic phrase a better will, which implies the idea of continual and progressive transformations toward the goal of brotherhood among States With this conviction, we support the proposal on the agenda which gives us the opportunity to make an evaluation that we feel is more ambitious and at the same time more direct and practical: the extension of a, kind of good will doctrine to all States alike  It would be a collective appeal, born of the Organization, and its aim in these times of conflict that disturbs the peace of the world would be the defeat or at least the diminishing of the warlike spirit that blocks the peaceful solution of the international conflicts threatening mankind The foregoing remarks make this an appropriate time to refer to the countries that share the Korean peninsula The Dominican Government has often advocated dialog as the master key that opens the door to good understanding and helps in finding peaceful formulas for settling the conflicts that affect various areas of the earth  Accordingly we favor the resumption of discussions between South Korea and North Korea so that the Koreans themselves may find favorable conditions that can lead to the most suitable independent and peaceful solutions, the reestablishment of mutual trust and the achievement of a lasting peace between the two communities in accordance with the principles of the Charter, in particular the principle concerning the free selfdetermination of peoples on a footing of equality and mutual respect 'One supremely important event that serves as yet another example of the dangers lying in wait for the international legal community and thus for the maintenance of peace is the unjustified invasion of Afghanistan, which is contrary to the basic principles of the Charter We cannot ignore the fact that it is the responsibility and within the jurisdiction of the Organization to restore the rights trampled underfoot by some States to the detriment of others, when generally speaking the actions are not in response to an act of aggression  Even in such an exceptional case such actions are lawful only when the Security Council has before it an armed conflict, which is not the case with the invading country In those circumstances, in order to eliminate the precedent tendentiously created and the consequences of a fait accompli, the least we can hope is that the peace loving countries will support the resolution approved by the Council of the European Community calling for an international conference to find a satisfactory solution that will permit Afghanistan to recover its independence and return to its previous status as a nonaligned country 2Within those peaceful outlines proposed by the European Council to the Soviet Union to permit the convening of the conference as quickly as possible, it is absolutely necessary that a consensus in favor of such an initiative be reached at this session  Its implementation would diminish the existing tension that is disturbing the peace We have devoted particular attention to agenda item  on the review of the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security for we consider the maintenance of the principle of nonintervention to be vital to the maintenance of peace We believe that observers of the international political scene cannot fail to be aware of the violations and the progressive weakening in recent years of the principle of nonintervention, which is the backbone of the maintenance of peace under the aegis of the United Nations  That has been happening despite the General Assembly reaffirmation last year [resolution , on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security, of the universal and unconditional validity of the basic principles of the Charter, which apply equally to all countries without distinctions of any kind At that time, States were urged to comply strictly with their obligations under the Charter, and it was urged that the provisions of the Declaration be applied as a means of making peaceful coexistence possible We cannot fail to note the urgent need to practice and support noninterference in the internal affairs of States and to have recourse to peaceful methods for the solution of disputes  That proposal for strengthening peace and security is one for which we should all fight, in circumstances in which it would open wider the doors to international cooperation and render understanding among nations more effective Conflicts undeniably persist in areas of Africa  The situation in Angola and the matter of Namibia are cases in point  Another worrisome problem is that notwithstanding the provisions forbidding the practice of apartheid, it continues to be a cause of friction and could lead to an explosion of violence, which is the principal enemy of peace We deplore the fact that in certain areas of conflict the atmosphere is not conducive to the discovery of correct formulas for peaceful solution through discussion  We can rejoice, however, in the fact that Egypt and Israel have been holding meetings concerning the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Sinai Peninsula  That will be a very promising beginning for resolute steps forward in accordance with the Camp David accords  It proves that the climate is becoming more conducive to having peace gradually lead to a new era for the Middle East, an area that for more than years has been overwhelmed by unpredictable negative risks At its thirtyfifth session the General Assembly considered a proposal by the Federal Republic of Germany for the creation of an appropriate mechanism for finding ways to control the alarming flood of refugees, which, in the words of the proposing nation, has become a growing threat to goodneighborly relations among States  Consequently, it is a difficult problem, particularly for countries that have a common border The Dominican delegation fully shares those concerns and would support the establishment of an ad hoc committee to assume the responsibilities deriving from the program for International cooperation to avert new flows of refugees \\\\The conflict between Iran and Iraq continues without the parties having found suitable formulas to end it by means of a system for peacefully resolving disputes and conflicts  We feel that mediation by the States Members of this Organization is in order, so that the parties involved may arrive at an honorable solution to end the military confrontation that has been devastating the peoples of both nations and which could degenerate into a major disruption in the area Respecting the principles of nonintervention and selfdetermination of peoples, the Dominican Government shares the concern of the countries that support peace and human solidarity regarding the present situation in the sister Republic of El Salvador  We express our most fervent hope that the matter will be resolved quickly and in accordance with the sovereign will of the people of El Salvador A review of the figures, in the light of what has been called the population explosion, causes concern when estimates and evaluations point to the existence on our planet of billion human beings by the year  That trend is occurring despite indications of concern by many countries regarding the prospects of excessive population growth, a problem that urgently calls for particular attention to family planning As regards the Dominican Republic, the Organization is aware that the official plans cautiously being put into practice in our country are proving very satisfactory  We could say that in the Dominican Republic we are shaping a national awareness propitious to the practice of family planning and responsible parenthood and antithetical to the practice of abortion The Dominican Republic is honored to have been selected as the site of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women  I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the future headquarters of that Institute are now in the final stages of constriction and will be inaugurated in the near future  We encourage all States Members of the Organization to contribute to the trust fund for the Institute The problem of food supply is developing at the same pace as that of population growth  For that reason, the entire world should recognize the importance of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  It is therefore regrettable that after almost years of devotion to the work of establishing scientific principles to govern that inexhaustible source of wealth, it has not yet been possible to complete the final instrument that would be a source of salvation for the human race, threatened as it is with shortage in the near future of the resources that are indispensable for its survival and progress  Therefore, regardless of the reasons for the failure to complete the final debates and to move next year to the signature of the longed for convention on the law of the sea,, it would seem desirable to sign the proposed convention at Caracas next year, as soon as possible after next year sessions in New York Population growth in the world undeniably constitutes a problem that makes imperative the vigorous and decisive mobilization of all production resources  Based on those convictions, the Government of the Dominican Republic has been encouraging agrarian reform and is devoting particular attention to agroindustry Many years ago a famous Dominican writer and politician, Ulises Francisco Espaillat, father of independence and President of my country, had the foresight to point out the importance of agriculture for our nation  He declared with inspiring authority that work must be glorified and that of all industries agriculture was the easiest, the most useful, the most generous and the most fruitful  This exemplary Dominican added with patriotic ardor that it was the most noble industry, the industry that most effectively provided that independence of position most suitable for citizens who wish to remain free and independent The economy of the Dominican Republic has not escaped the widespread effects of convulsions in other economies, which result from the irrepressible forces of this historic period of emerging decisions, a period that is irresistibly striving towards a new economic order as we approach the year  Nevertheless, the efforts made by our Government during the last three years though troubled in part, especially by the forces of nature thanks to the pragmatic actions of Antonio Guzman, head of the Dominican State, show a normal situation in the national economy, in the context of free enterprise and the full force and effect of public freedoms A cautious monetary and fiscal policy is being carried out  The fiscal policy provides for adjustment of public expenditures to the income from taxes; under the monetary policy, unduly rapid expansion of the money supply has been brought under control and the money has been channeled chiefly towards the productive sectors, particularly agriculture and industry An aggressive policy to promote nontraditional exports is being followed and is producing positive results;  It should be mentioned that under a recent law, generous incentives are given to the exporters of nontraditional products  One such incentive permits them to retain a portion of the foreign currencies earned by these exports, paying to the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic only an officially predetermined percentage Today more than ever we must keep in mind the mandate of the Creator of the Universe that man must earn his daily bread by the sweat of his brow  Thus, the divine work extends to the urgent mandate to win peace with the energy of our mortal, human blood  We venture to say that this is the primary challenge of our age, starting with our presence here at this time to fulfill a transcendent promise  The General Assembly must go in search of solutions required by conflicts that we cannot allow to continue and become chronic  A final explosion could jeopardize the very existence of the Organization, which is the only constructive institution created by the last world war  A repetition of that conflict must be prevented at all costs To conclude these reflections, we should like to call to mind the third encyclical of His Holiness Pope John Paul II, entitled Laborem Exercens, dedicated to those who earn their bread by the sweat of their brow, to workers of all kinds, manual, intellectual, industrial or agricultural, who labor in the midst of the most intense, sudden and ominous tensions In the midst of their debates, delegations at this thirtysixth session of the General Assembly should meditate on the exhortation contained in the vary word work which has come down through the ages as a perpetual and resolute echo of the voice of God  It is a great honour for me speak from this rostrum of the world Organization in order to make known my Government views and feelings on the many important problems that are to be discussed at the seventeenth session of the General Assembly I should like to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr  Muhammad Zafrulla Khan for his welldeserved election to preside over our deliberations  His great learning, his long experience in the service of the loftiest of international causes, his wisdom and judgement are, as we have seen here, the attributes that go to make a good President On behalf of the people and Government of the Dominican Republic, I extend a hearty welcome to the new States which are joining this family of nations  Our welcome and our best wishes go to Rwanda, Burundi, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago, as also to Algeria, which has just been admitted to the United Nations At home, the Dominican Republic has begun to make amends for the cruelties, tortures, persecutions, assassinations, deprivations and abuses inflicted on the Dominican; nation by the tyrant Trujillo, who was fortunately brought to justice on May  by a group of national heroes whose two sole surviving members, Mr  Antonio Imbert Barrera and Mr  Luis Amiama, are serving on the Council of State The present Government has undertaken to attend to the immediate needs created by the chaotic situation and, with the resolute cooperation of the people and the help of the Alliance for Progress programme, it has provided new opportunities for employment in emergency public works projects  The wealth amassed under the dictatorship has been invested in a development corporation which is using, for the benefit of the Dominican people and on behalf of that people, the riches of which they had previously been divested  A housing programme has been initiated; an agrarian reform is being carried out, with the result that hundreds of families have been settled, on land previously occupied by the relations and henchmen of the tyrant  The international credit of the Republic has been restored and the banking system has undergone a scientific reconstruction which will enable the nation wealth to be better utilized The Council of State also has the honour, as care taker Government, of establishing a democratic system, based on the will of the people, which will be expressed in the course of free elections to be held on December, in which the attributes of the individual citizen — those which lend dignity to man — will finally acquire their full moaning  This task will be carried out with the valuable assistance of the Technical Electoral Commission which the Dominican Government asked the Organization of American States to provide At the international level, the Dominican Republic is preparing to fulfil all its obligations and to cooperate to the best of its ability in ensuring that the international community and the juridical instruments at its disposal shall acquire the maximum efficacy With that end in view, my country will abide by all the decisions taken by the United Nations, in keeping with the Charter on which it is founded and in particular with the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice whereby the expenses incurred in operations ordered by the Assembly shall be borne, together with the regular expenses, by all Members of the Organization  The Dominican Republic regards compliance with these decisions as an unavoidable duty and an absolute necessity, not only because it is an obligation under the Charter but because it implies support of one of the most important organs of the United Nations — the organ whose basic function is to give meaning and scope to the standards of international law  To disregard the rulings of the International Court of Justice would be to undermine the new international order which the United Nations is seeking to establish  It would, in fact, be a backward step that would deal a severe blow to law and order and would establish force as the determining factor in relations between States With regard to disarmament and all that this problem entails, the Dominican Republic considers that the overarmed Powers are called upon to end the state of mistrust and fear in which mankind is living, by deciding to put an end to the armaments race  The world demands this because disarmament is not a problem which affects the armed Powers alone but is a general problem which concerns all of us, since modern wars are not mere episodes confined to tire belligerents, but tragedies which involve the whole of mankind One of the many problems which the Dominican Republic views with concern is the plight of the underdeveloped countries  Until these nations enjoy the benefits of social justice and economic prosperity, they will always be a prey to anxiety and frustration —sentiments which sow the seeds of unrest and are the prelude to agitation and subversive ideas incompatible with the atmosphere of peace in which peoples wish to live  There can be no democracy or freedom in a world in which poverty and social injustice prevail The twin concepts of freedom and democracy will reach true fulfilment when the efforts that are now being devoted to the armaments race are used to eradicate the causes of poverty and injustice  The Dominican Republic accordingly commends and supports the measures that have been proposed in order to remedy this situation and especially the plan which is now in operation to promote social advancement and raise the level of living in accordance with a broader concept of freedom, as provided in the Charter  It also fully endorses the remarks made in a recent report by U Thant, the SecretaryGeneral: If this Organization is to make the principles enshrined in the Preamble of the Charter a living reality, there must be no pause in the determined, sincere and continuing campaign: to reduce world tensions and hostility  The people of the world who continue to live in such a tense and surcharged atmosphere, replete with the ever present threat of total destruction, are entitled to look forward to the dawn of a' new era in which every man, woman and child in every country can be expected to live above want and in dignity, at peace with themselves and with the rest of mankind  [A//Add l, page]In keeping with these ideas, the liquidation of colonialism which must proceed at a faster rate should not be restricted merely to the granting of independence to peoples who have been subjugated but must take on a broader dimension  The political solution, in the form of liberation from all foreign domination, is of paramount importance but is not enough  It alone will not appease the urge for emancipation  Economic independence is just as important as political independence, for until it is fully achieved the bonds of colonialism will persist  As long as those peoples remain in the background, as mere suppliers of raw materials to the highly industrialized centres, they will not have achieved complete freedom nor Will they have attained the complete happiness to which they have a right  It is therefore imperative that the plan to which I referred just now should be extended to include them, in a positive way, since they are the oneswho’ need it most at the present time Fortunately, in the Western Hemisphere this serious problem is being solved by the determination of our peoples to put the programmes of the Alliance for Progress into effect without delay; those programmes are already sapping the foundations of a feudal era which is giving way to a revolutionary evolution, as it has been termed by the President of the Dominican Republic and of the Council of State It is a pity that these programmes for social progress are being constantly held up by the lastditch efforts of reactionaries who are endeavouring to retain their privileges and by the communists, who see in it the defeat of their tactics, which are based primarily on demagogy  Obstacles of the kind that are now being encountered by the Alliance for Progress were similarly experienced in Europe at the time of the Marshall Plan The impartial study of the ideological trends which divide the world, is a privilege of the free man  Those of us who bear the grave and solemn responsibility of speaking from this rostrum have an inescapable obligation to analyse the merits and demerits of the two contending positions  So long as the spectre of man destruction haunts a century that has suffered the tragedy of two world wars and a series of other wars, confined to specific geographical areas, which have decimated the youth of five continents, the weight and significance of each word, of each phrase and of each idea spoken from this forum must of necessity be directed towards the promotion of a worldwide desire for peace and justice for all  Peace and justice cannot be achieved by vitriolic attacks or by slander and false accusations, by the use of demagogy or by hasty attempts to impose a particular system on a people without allowing it to listen to the debates — not the fallacies and pretexts but the substance of the ideas that seek to influence and guide the world  The United Nations cannot and must not deceive the nations of which it is composed, for if this were to happen, civilization would find itself in a vacuum The Cuban situation and its implications for the regional system has been referred to in this Assembly and we must therefore discuss it  The Cuban Government has cut itself off from the rest of the hemisphere by failing to meet the conditions which the charter of the Organization of American States prescribes for its members  We wonder what caused the withdrawal of the Cuban Government from the continental system  In order to answer that question we must make a brief excursion into history From the very beginning of the independence movement in America, the struggle, acquired a mystique which lent it greater impetus and led it from victory to victory, on to its final triumph  Basically, the struggle was not for the solo purpose of gaining freedom but was also waged with the aim of improving the system of government prevailing at that time, which was absolute monarchy in which the monarch was sovereign ruler and proclaimed his powers to be of divine origin After the United States achieved independence, the concept — not new in theory but new in practice —  that the people alone are sovereign began to gain ground  This concept calls to mind Benjamin Franklin, of whom it was  said: He snatched the lightening from the skies and the sceptre from the tyrants  The sceptre of tyrants was the symbol of sovereignty  Seized from its holder, it passed to a new sovereign — the people  Since then a new concept has grown up in America, that of selfdetermination  Each people decided its future as a free nation by force of arms, whereby it severed its ties with the mother country  But within the new boundaries of the State, the nation destinies had to be decided by the people, established as the new sovereign, which, unlike the earlier physical entity of the monarch or aspirant to the monarchy, was a complex, manysided being, made up of thousands of individuals whose opinions, as yet unknown, had to be expressed peacefully, in order to be able to respond to the truth, to the new principle that only the people are sovereign  Nil novi sub sole — nothing is new under the sun  An old principle was thus given a new application to meet the needs of the times, which were representative democracy and electoral processes and procedures  Having grown wary as the result of previous experiences, the people began from the very outset to resist such expedients as acclamations at public meetings and armed coercion, and to understand that in order to ensure that the elections resulted in genuine representation of the new sovereign, it was essential to safeguard the process by guarantees of all the civil liberties which were embodied in the constitutions and their amendments Latin America has been engaged for more than a century — for reasons which I shall not go into here, owing to the shortage of time — in a continual struggle against the violation of these principles which were so dear to the founders of the various nations of the continent  Each dictatorship set out with the sincere or feigned intention of remedying the deficiencies of the preceding regime  It is equally true, however, that each dictatorship has always tried to justify itself by a show of respect — naturally spurious — for representative democracy, no matter what enormities it committed against the rights of the people Foremost among the rights of the people which were violated or suppressed was the right to life, which was abruptly ended  By thei firing squad of the political opponent or by the assassin dagger or threatened by the dungeon  Then there was the deprivation of all liberties and of the right to a better economic existence based on social justice and without the sway of the traditional oligarchies, feudal practices and the near enslavement of the less privileged classes When the interAmerican system was established, this centuryold tradition was incorporated into it as a basic principle; thus, the exercise of representative democracy is an essential requirement for membership of the group  Renunciation of this principle implies automatic exclusion from the system and it was this principle that was rejected by the Cuban Government when it announced its adherence to MarxismLeninism It should be made clear that the system has not set itself up as a stern accusor to browbeat Governments which, owing to temporary circumstances or to more or less prolonged lapses, hive departed from the basic tenets of the system  This is a mistake that democratic Governments must strive to correct It can readily be seen that the juridical and political standards of the interAmerican system entails the following progressive series of conditions: (a) respect for human rights; (b) exercise of the inherent freedoms of the citizen, without which no opinion can be expressed; (c) free elections, with majority and minority representation of the people, as appropriate; (d) freedom not only to constitute a government by means of elections but also to replace it by the same means  These are the conditions for achieving representative democracy and through it — and only through it — selfdetermination  Parallel with these concepts, there has also developed, as an intrinsic part of the system, the principle of nonintervention, which has been of inestimable value in promoting interAmerican relations and has been the staunch defence of the weaker nations against the stronger  At times, this very principle has served certain regimes as a pretext for retaining power in outright violation of democratic precepts; at other times it has served as a pretext for evading action that should have been taken We are sure, however, that though the principle of nonintervention has not yet taken final shape it will eventually be defined in harmony with the new concept of the interdependence of States engaged in a common undertaking Against this background the Eighth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, at Punta del Este adopted resolution VI, which reads as follows: Whereas: The interAmerican system is based on consistent adherence by its constituent States to certain objectives and principles of solidarity, set forth in the instruments that govern it; Among these objectives and principles are those of respect for the freedom of man and preservation of his rights, the full exercise of representative democracy, nonintervention of one State in the internal or external affairs of another, and rejection of alliances and agreements that may lead to intervention in America by extracontinental Powers; The Seventh Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, held in San José, Costa Rica, condemned the intervention or the threat of intervention of extracontinental communist Powers in the hemisphere and reiterated the obligation of the American States to observe faithfully the principles of the regional organization; The present Government of Cuba has identified itself with the principles of MarxistLeninist ideology, has established apolitical, economic, and social system based on that doctrine, and accepts military assistance from extracontinental communist Powers, including even the threat of military intervention in America on the part of the Soviet Union; The Report of the InterAmerican Peace Committee to the Eighth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs establishes that: ‘The present connexions of the Government of Cuba with the SinoSoviet bloc of countries are evidently incompatible with the principles and standards that govern the regional system, and particularly with the collective security established by the Charter of the Organization of American States and the InterAmerican Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance’; The abovementioned Report of the InterAmerican Peace Committee also states that: ‘It is evident that the ties of the Cuban Government with the Sino Soviet bloc will prevent the said Government from fulfilling the obligations stipulated in the Charter of the Organization and the Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance’; Such a situation in an American State violates, the obligations inherent in membership in the regional system and is incompatible with that system; The attitude adopted by the present Government of Cuba and its acceptance of military assistance offered by extracontinental communist Powers breaks down the effective defence of the interAmerican system; and No member state of the interAmerican system can claim the rights; and privileges pertaining thereto if it denies or fails to recognize the corresponding obligation, Declares:  That, as a consequence of repeated acts, the present Government of Cuba has voluntarily placed itself outside the interAmerican system   That this situation demands unceasing vigilance on the part of the member States of the Organization of American States, which shall report to the Council any fact or situation that could endanger the peace and security of the hemisphere   That the American States have a collective interest in strengthening the interAmerican system and reuniting it on the basis of respect for human rights and the principles and objectives relative to the exercise of democracy set forth in the Charter of the Organization; and, therefore Resolves:  That adherence by any member of the Organization of American States to MarxismLeninism is incompatible with the interAmerican system and the alignment of such a government with the communist bloc breaks the unity and solidarity of the hemisphere   That the Council of the Organization of, American States and the other organs and organizations of the interAmerican system adopt without delay measures necessary to comply with this resolution The consequences of this resolution are revealed in the following communique, which has the distinction of having been approved unanimously by all the Foreign Ministers of America, or their representatives, at the recent informal meeting held at Washington  The communique reads as follows: In their informal meeting held in Washington, D C , on October and   the Foreign Ministers and Special Representatives of American Republics discussed in a spirit of strong friendship and cooperation the serious problems that face the Western Hemisphere  Although the informal character of the meeting precluded formal decisions or resolutions, which are in the competence, of the appropriate bodies of the OAS, the meeting was marked by extraordinary solidarity on matters affecting the security and wellbeing of the hemispheric system  The Ministers reviewed the resolutions adopted at the Eighth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, the progress made in response to them, and further steps which might be taken to give effect to those resolutions  During the meeting it was manifest that at the present juncture the most urgent of these problems, is the SinoSoviet intervention in Cuba as an attempt to convert the island into an armed base for communist penetration of the Americas and subversion of the democratic institutions of the Hemisphere  The meeting reiterated its adherence to the principles of selfdetermination, nonintervention and democracy as guiding standards of relations among the American nations  The meeting reflected the opinion that now more than ever it is necessary to strengthen the system of representative democracy and to redouble the efforts being made to bring harmonious progress the peoples, and the earliest and most effective improvement in their standard of living, within the framework of the Alliance for Progress, and with the most complete respect for human rights  Special consideration shall be given to expanding markets and increasing prices of Latin American primary products  The meeting reasserted the firm intention of the Governments represented and of the peoples of the American Republics to conduct themselves in accordance with the principles of the regional system, staunchly sustaining and consolidating the principles of the Charter of the Organization of American States, and affirmed the will to strengthen the security of the Hemisphere against all aggression from within or outside the Hemisphere and against 'all developments or situations capable of threatening the peace and security of the Hemisphere through the application of the InterAmerican Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance of Rio de Janeiro, It was the view of the Ministers that the existing organizations and bodies of the interAmerican system should intensify the carrying out of their respective duties with special and urgent attention to the situation created by the MarxistLeninist  regime in Cuba and that they should stand in readiness to consider the matter promptly if the situation requires measures beyond those already authorized  In the ideological struggle against communism, destroyer of man liberties, the meeting expressed the desire that the resources and methods inherent in the democratic system should be mobilized to bring the peoples to realize fully the difference between totalitarianism and democracy  The meeting reaffirmed its repudiation of repressive measures which, under the pretext of isolating or combating communism, may facilitate the appearance or strengthening of doctrines and methods which attempt to repress ideas of social progress and to confuse truly progressive and democratic labour organizations and cultural and political movements with communist subversion  The meeting observed that the interAmerican regional system has had since its beginnings characteristics of its own that are expressed in specific provisions agreed upon by a community of nations for its collective security and, therefore, that a  That the present Government of Cuba, which has officially identified itself as a MarxistLeninist Government, is incompatible with the principles and objectives of the interAmerican system   That this incompatibility excludes the present  Government of Cuba from participation in the inter American system  Military intervention of communist powers in Cuba cannot be justified as a situation analogous to the defensive measures adopted in other parts of the Free World in order to face Soviet imperialism  The meeting expressed the need for undertaking the actions called for by Resolution VIII of the Eighth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, especially paragraph  also including the use of their ships in the Cuban trade, in the light of the new developments taking place in Cuba  It also called upon all other independent countries to review their policies in this regard  The meeting agreed that it is necessary for the countries, in accordance with their laws and constitutional precepts, to intensify measures to prevent agents and groups of international communism from carrying on their activities of a subversive nature  The meeting recalled that the Soviet Union intervention in Cuba threatens the unity of the Americas and of its democratic institutions, and that this intervention has special characteristics which; pursuant to paragraph of Resolution II of the Eighth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, call for the adoption of special measures, both individual and collective  The meeting observed that it is desirable to intensify individual and collective surveillance of the delivery of arms and implements of war and all other items of strategic importance to the communist regime of Cuba, in order to prevent the secret accumulation in the island of arms that can be used foil; offensive purposes against the hemisphere  The meeting concurred in the wish that studies be undertaken urgently, in accordance with Resolution II of the Eighth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, of the transfer of funds to the other American Republics for subversive purposes, the flow of subversive propaganda and the utilization of Cuba as a base for training in subversive techniques  The meeting voiced the traditional fraternal affection of all the American peoples for the people of Cuba and their deep sympathy for the victims of the present regime, and expressed the hope that the Cuban people may return as a full member of the democratic American family of nations, under a government compatible with the purposes and principles of the interAmerican system With the deliberate intention of distorting the facts, an attempt has been made to represent the case of Cuba as a conflict involving that country and the United States alone, to the total exclusion of the Latin American Republics  This concept, of course, does not correspond to the facts, as is amply demonstrated by the Punta del Este documents and those, of the Meeting of Foreign Ministers at Washington to which I have referred  From the very moment that the Government of Cuba turned its back on democracy and its contractual obligations under the interAmerican system and began to violate — often very seriously — the spirit and letter of treaties and conventions of vital importance to the continent, an extremely serious crisis arose between the Cuban Government the Cuban people and between the Cuban Government and the Government and peoples of rest of America The Communist propaganda line, which is designed to convey the impression that a conflict exists solely between Cuba and the United States, is damaging to Latin America because it seeks to make Latin America, appear as if it were a group of republics which are not conscious of their own responsibilities and are incapable of discerning the imminent danger to which they are exposed  This danger is caused by the existence of a Government which, on American territory, has turned the land of José Martí, the great apostle of freedom, into a SinoSoviet centre for military and political operations and for the ideological subversion of the democratic institutions of all the American nations, of their Christian ethics and of their peaceful coexistenceOwing to its exceptional political, military and economic relations with Russia and Communist China, the Communist Government of Cuba constitutes a threat — unparalleled in the history of the hemisphere — to the peace, security and sovereignty of the American States The problem is not a quarrel or conflict between Washington and Havana  In an interAmerican context it is a conflict between Cuba and the republics of our continent, just as within a world context it is part of the struggle between East and West, between democracy and nondemocracy Convinced as we are of the greatness of the nations that are Members of the United Nations, we find ourselves asking the following question, which we have no hesitation in putting to this august Assembly: are there any peoples whose views are not legitimately represented here Of necessity, and in order to do justice the profundity of the idea behind this question, we must begin by saying that the Government of the Dominican Republic was not born of popular elections but of popular acceptance, won by conduct based on undeniable freedoms, on clearcut guarantees for the honest citizen, on the equitable administration of justice and above all on the firm determination of the President of the Republic and the members of the Council of State to hold elections in full view of any international observers who may wish to witness them  For, not only is it not afraid, but it is anxious for the world to see the triumph of the will of a people which, for more than three decades, has been pining for its freedom behind the prison bars of Trujillo unprecedented tyranny Thus, on December, the Dominican Republic will select a Government through the proper and free exercise of the right to vote  In the certainty that this will come to pass, I appear before you with the proud humility of one who knows that he is not one of the elect but simply a servant of western civilization with every right to ask: are there any peoples whose views are not legitimately represented here The people seek peace — but not the peace of the firing squad or of the prisons packed with political opponents whose only crime was to disagree with the regime in power  The people seek peace — but not peace born of the sufferings of exile or peace born of the daily flight of those who risk their lives to escape  The people seek peace — but not peace which does away with the freedom of the Press, which stifles the thoughts of men after robbing them, of their right to speak and turns them into terrorized beings who tremble in the presence of the accuser, who may send them to the scaffold on a trumpedup charge  The people seek peace — but not peace which prevents the worker from exercising his right to strike or robs the universities of their independence or compels the peasant to carry a gun to defend ideas which he does not understand  The people seek peace — but not peace which robs families of their loving children in order to send them away for indoctrination, whence they return so devoid of all filial affection that they inform on their parents  The people seek peace — but not peace that prohibits the holding of meetings in the fear that genuine elections will show the world how unpopular the leaders of the day really are  The people seek peace — but no peace which exports subversion, unrest and conspiracy to neighbouring countries, which are thus condemned to live in a state of constant anxiety, defending their democratic institutions  The people seek peace, but it is a different kind of peace  It is the peace which helps to eradicate all those evils, to remove the threat of war, subversion, hatred, unrest and terrorism  The peace that promotes understanding, industry, culture and happiness Lastly, it is the peace which allows people to worship their own God and gives us the freedom to beg ours, from this high rostrum, to guide the United Nations in its search for a way to live together in dignity, in peace without fear and justice without humiliation  I should like first to express to Mr  Hollai on this occasion my sincere congratulations on his unanimous election to the distinguished office of the President of the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly and also to extend our congratulations to the other members of the General Committee  The presidency of the General Assembly constitutes a singular honour to the Member State that occupies it, as well as to its regional group  My delegation also congratulates Mr  Kittani, who presided over the thirtysixth session of the General Assembly with great success  My delegation also wishes to express its gratitude to the SecretaryGeneral, Mr  Javier Perez de Cuellar, whose experience and hard work in the service of the United Nations have already been clearly demonstrated, and represent for the countries of the American continent a source of legitimate pride and satisfaction  The report which he has submitted to the General Assembly is brilliant, and is proof of this; of the many documents that the Organization produces, only a very few are as important as this call to reflection  His words not only enumerate the great problems that oppress the world, but also propose solutions to these grave and multiple problems  With the sincerity and emotion essential to the task of considering the fate of peoples, the SecretaryGeneral has made recommendations that do not shrink from criticism of and alternatives for the action of bodies within the United Nations itself, such as the Security Council  His considered and valuable presentation has won the support and general approval of world opinion, and my delegation supports it fully The Dominican Republic is conscious of the complex and serious problems affecting the international community that are being debated at this session, and of the fact that those problems require measures commensurate with their seriousness and urgency, We are confident that within the framework of the law and the principles of the Charter will be possible to adopt the measures that can lead to a better and more just international order It is for me a source of great satisfaction to participate in the Assembly as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the new constitutional Government of my country, inaugurated on August of this year  The Government headed by President Salvador Jorge Blanco assumed office in the Dominican Republic through the free and sovereign will of our people, expressed in free elections This Government is the result of the institutional strength of a country that has been fulfilling its democratic vocation through constant struggle and great sacrifice  During the last years we have not only removed the obstacles that checked our democratic development, but we have also overcome situations that affected our standing as a sovereign nation The Dominican Republic is now enjoying a period characterized by the consolidation of its political democracy and is facing the urgent task of promoting economic development and social justice  At this time, within our institutional framework and with full respect for human rights, ideological pluralism and absolute freedom, the Government intends to make those changes and reforms that are necessary to strengthen our economic democracy, one of the most legitimate aspirations of developing countries We consider it appropriate to point out those accomplishments because we firmly believe that the continuous and strengthening exercise of democracy in a small country such as ours, belonging to the group of third world nations, is an example to be proud of and strengthens our national purpose to achieve our own destiny without interference The political stability of Dominican Republic has created conditions which enable us to increase our effective participation in international relations, and to that end we offer our full cooperation in the search for peaceful solutions, strictly adhering to the principles of international law and of the Charter, at a time when great conflicts and tension are shaking the international community  This activity will be exercised within our sovereign rights, without prejudices, inflexible positions or hegemonic constraints The strengthening of the traditional bonds of friendship that join us to certain countries will not be an obstacle to the substantial broadening of our frontiers in the vast and complex field of international relations, in as far as this is required by our national interests  Above any other consideration, the unchangeable norm of our conduct in the international community will be absolute respect for and adherence to the legal and moral principles sustained and supported by the nations which together with ours form the Organization In his inaugural speech as constitutional President of the Dominican Republic, Mr  Salvador Jorge Blanco outlined the attitude of his Government in international affairs in the following words: We declare ourselves men of America, an essential part of an international community full of heroic deeds, an integral part of the new world searching daily for a collective existence, of the union of wills and efforts dedicated to the defense of social justice, to the struggle against underdevelopment  In these difficult moments for the countries of the third world the solidarity of the people of America is necessary and urgent and requires mutual support to help them overcome their pressing problems of subsistence and their terrible economic and political problems  In these difficult times, America, our Magna Patria, as it was called by Pedro Hennquez Urena, should be a spearhead to thwart the constant menaces of a world holocaust and should be a bulwark of equilibrium in the concert of nations of the world  Within this new spirit, the Dominican Government has decided to exercise further its traditional vocation for peaceful action and to participate as an active element in the search for solutions to the conflicts presently afflicting our brother countries of Central America, and we are also prepared to collaborate in alleviating the international tension that affects other nations in the Caribbean basin This attitude on the part of the Dominican Government is reflected in the decision to offer our immediate support for the purposes expressed jointly by the Presidents of Mexico and Venezuela in a letter they addressed to the President of the United States of America, to the Council of Government of Nicaragua and to the President of Honduras, expressing their concern over the tense situation existing between the latter two countries In this instance the Dominican Government did not confine itself to simple support but expressed its willingness to participate, in whatever useful way it could, without detriment to the principle of nonintervention, in any effort to normalize relations between those two brother countries This position on the part of my Government had already been expressed in the joint declaration issued in Santo Domingo on August last by the heads of State of Venezuela, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Belize and the Dominican Republic, on the express initiative of my Government, in which those distinguished statesmen ratified their support for the fundamental principles of international law, which include the sovereign equality of all countries, respect for their independence and the territorial integrity, respect for the principle of nonintervention, non recourse to threats or use of force to resolve international conflicts, ideological pluralism, the selfdetermination of nations and respect for and faithful compliance with international treaties The declaration emphasizes: within the framework of the different proposals for peace in the Central American region and the mechanisms to implement them, rejection of violent solutions, negotiations and dialogue are necessary for the solution of this crisis, a solution which must be the exclusive product of a common will and effort, with a view to promoting democracy, economic development and social justice Moreover, we also made a cordial appeal to those democratic countries interested in the establishment of peace to apply their best efforts to achieve that end  For my country that declaration forms part of a profound commitment  We must help to stop the present bloodshed and thus avert the possible danger of cruel and extended confrontations  For our brother nations of Central America we desire the full exercise of human rights  We consider it just and urgent that these countries be able to choose freely their own destiny and to devote their energies to full economic and social development We must emphasize that there is perhaps no other region as cohesive in its geography, its history, its ethnology, its economy and its culture as the Caribbean  This region is characterized by the coexistence of traditional and emerging States  However, due to causes alien to the interests of its peoples, interchanges among the countries of the region have not been achieved to the extent that we would desire and welcome  The Dominican Republic has special characteristics which make it an ideal bridge for the realization of such exchanges among Caribbean countries, especially at a time when we are strengthening our relations with the region new States For the Dominican Republic it is not Utopian to believe and to say that the Central American and Caribbean region must become a zone of peace, of balance, stability, pluralism and the total rejection of military solutions This year there occurred in the South Atlantic a deplorable event that disturbed the region but brought about solidarity in support of the just territorial claims of a brother nation An invariable aspect of the foreign policy of the Dominican Republic is our opposition to all forms and vestiges of colonialism in any part of the world  This has been a firm and consistent position expressed on innumerable occasions and in different international forums  Within the Organization, from the very outset, the Dominican delegation has constantly supported all anticolonial recommendations and measures and has with clear determination contributed to the worthy process of decolonization that has been realized by the United Nations Throughout its history the Dominican Republic has been a peaceloving country  This position is unchangeable and is universally recognized  We believe that peace is the common goal of all mankind, the highest of social values, the indispensable norm for a harmonious and civilized life within each country and internationally We therefore address a cordial appeal to the Republic of Argentina and the United Kingdom to resume within the framework of the United Nations the necessary negotiations that will through dialogue and understanding permit a dignified, honourable and permanent solution to the conflict through the peaceful mechanism available to sovereign States under the Charter of the United Nations and international law We consider it appropriate to point out that this deplorable experience has deeply affected public faith in the effectiveness of the InterAmerican Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, signed at Rio de Janeiro in  as a proper instrument for the preservation of peace in our hemisphere and has once again demonstrated the urgent need to enrich and strengthen the system of collective security in that part of the world with the same firm will and resolve manifest in Bogota when the Organization of American States was founded there The Dominican Republic expresses its deep concern at the grave economic crisis affecting the international community, which is characterized by a reduced rate of economic growth, a deterioration in the terms of trade, the stagnation of trade, a decrease in the prices of raw materials, high interest rates and increasing protectionism by the industrialized nations, together with the reduction of international economic aid and cooperation  To give just one revealing example, the increase in the gross national product barely reached per cent in the industrialized countries for and  and it will probably be at zero in  This has produced a considerable increase in unemployment and thereby a drasticreduction in the demand for the products and raw materials on the export of which the existence of the third world depends Although this problem affects all countries, it is undeniable that the countries within the underdeveloped group that do not produce oil are those that suffer most as a result of the present international economic crisis  In fact, in real terms, the prices of our commodities have reached the lowest level recorded in the last three decades and are substantially lower than those that prevailed during the recession of the mid  The most important consequence of this situation for the underdeveloped countries that do not produce oil is that in most of tl cm real per capita income has been drastically reduced for the first time since the Second World War This situation has created a grave imbalance in the external sector of our economies characterized by high deficits, for which we have been compelled to compensate with unprecedented increases in our foreign debt  This high level of debt today constitutes one of the most serious threats to the financial stability of many nations  We want to use this international forum to request the flexibility that the international banking community must show as regards the repayment of those debts, because it must be remembered that they have been caused by a very unusual economic situation We support the conclusions set forth at the recent meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Toronto stressing the enormous responsibility now facing the main industrialized countries as regards the recovery of their economies, the reduction of present interest rates and reversal of the present isolationist trend so as to bring about closer and more generalized international cooperation We also propose the study and identification of proper recommendations to curtail the increasing protectionist trend in industrialized nations, which manifests itself in the establishment of unjustified trade barriers that obstruct international trade and limit the expansion of markets for the products of the third world nations In other words our delegation considers that the NorthSouth dialogue must be awakened from its present stagnation and be activated as an instrument for frank discussions concerning the contradictions between the developed and the developing worlds  The present condition of the international economy reveals symptoms similartoo similar to be ignored to those that existed before the world depression of the , whose disastrous consequences we all know Let us pledge that during the current decade, through global negotiations within the framework of the Organization, those indispensable measures required for the achievement of the much awaited new international economic order will be taken and make it possible for us to live in a more secure and just world As we examine the problems that affect the international community, we cannot forget the danger posed by the policies of increasing armaments pursued by the superPowers  Our concern increases when we observe with anxiety and frustration the paralysis of negotiations on disarmament and the fact that we cannot foresee the establishment of a new order that will give peace to the world  It is a paradox that while the great nations argue over formulas to reduce the tremendous power of their forces of mutual destruction new installations with nuclear missiles of incalculable efficiency are being set up on their territories  If this latent menace became reality, it would imply the total destruction of the world that we live in  The danger becomes greater with the outbreak of limited conflicts in sensitive areas of the world, conflicts that could easily become uncontrollable and result in a nuclear holocaust In this situation of extreme danger to all mankind, there is an urgent need for all Member States to act together to create the proper climate for constructive dialogue between the big world Powers One of the dangers is the explosive situation of increasing violence in the Middle East which during recent decades has been a negative factor for the prospects for balance and peace in the world  The seriousness of the situation has been made tragically evident by the recent horrible massacre of Palestinian refugees in the camps of Lebanon, a dreadful act of genocide that has shaken the conscience of the entire international community  Our Government has publicly emphatically condemned that horrible massacre, and has demanded that international bodies prevent its repetition and determine responsibility for it Our voice has joined those of other nations clamouring for an effective guarantee of the integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon, an unfortunate country with which we have very cordial relations  We are aware that the problems in that area of conflict have demonstrated that the Palestinian question is one of the decisive factors in the crisis  We believe that no permanent, serious solution can be reached if we do not provide a mechanism that assures the Palestinian people the exercise of its inalienable right to self determination, which has been recognized by the United Nations Similarly, we reiterate our policy that any serious attempt to achieve peace and coexistence in that tormented region must take into account Security Council resolution (, which, among other things, affirms the State of Israel right to exist We regard as timely and essential to the peace effort the proposal made by the SecretaryGeneral to convert the Security Council into a world forum where all the parties concerned in the problem of the Middle East may sit at the same negotiating table The Dominican Republic feels closely linked to the Arab world by the strong connections created by the historical emigrations to our territory of Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian citizens, who have enriched the cultural, social and economic heritage of our country over the years  Consequently, my Government has affirmed its determination to establish or strengthen political, economic and other ties with many of the countries of the Arab world, within the framework of international law and the principles of the Charter The war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran, an unfortunate confrontation between two Moslem countries, is a cause of deep concern to us  We hope that a solution will be found in the near future, one restoring peace and making possible a policy of goodneighbourliness, with the full guarantee of reciprocal rightswithin the framework of the United Nations, of course Fundamentally, the composition of the Dominican people is the product of an interracial union of Indians, whites and blacks  The result of this ethnic mixture is a mixed race of which we are truly proud  The Dominican Republic reiterates in this world forum that for us any kind of discrimination or segregation, any attempt to separate the population on racial, religious or other lines, is a crime against humanity  Therefore, we reject the policies and practices of apartheid  We take this opportunity to affirm that the Dominican Republic condemns without reservation violations of human rights in whatever circumstances and wherever they occur Our profound conviction on the matter and our resulting firm rejection of such attempts have a special meaning at this particular time, when we have just inaugurated in the city of Santo Domingo a monument to Brother Antonio Montesinos  A magnificent work architecturally and sculpturally, the monument is a gift from the Government of Mexico to the people of the Dominican Republic  Brother Antonio Montesinos proclaimed in a sermon in our island in  By what right and with what justice do you keep these Indians under such horrible servitude  Are they not men  Have they not rational spirits  That was his cry of concern from Santo Domingo, the first act in defence of human rights in the new world On October, Hispanic Day, our President, at the inauguration of the monument, recalled that pronouncement and its farreaching consequences when, in the presence of President Jose Lopez Portillo of Mexico,he said: The rights of man, which, under another name, Brother Antonio Montesinos fought for, have been a permanent guiding light for the Dominican people  Even in those dark days when liberty was denied to us, the pursuit of freedom became the principal motive which unified our wills, criteria and actions  Only time has separated those historic moments of the struggle for liberty and democracy in our country  Our political democracy, today fully achieved, may be the great answer to those struggles and to a full awareness of them, and the role this plays within our continent Geographical differences do not prevent us from recalling the struggles of other peoples, however distant they may be from the Antilles  We support the efforts of the people of Namibia to regain its independence  We also express our concern about foreign interventions in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  We hope that through peaceful dialogue and the use of the machinery provided by the Charter the Korean people may be able to secure their desired unification into one sovereign State At this time, when territories are the source of stillunresolved conflicts and problems, the seas may contribute to the wellbeing of the world  We are now witnessing the humanization of the seas through the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea that declared the seabed to be the common heritage of all mankind  The Conference was one of the great successes of the General Assembly and proof of this body effectiveness within the United Nations  Since  when the Conference on the Law of the Sea began, it has been working with a new vision of international law and cooperation and is laying down rules that would satisfy our aspirations to abolish privileges, to protect the environment and to achieve peaceful coexistence  The new Convention on the Law of the Sea, in establishing a new and fruitful reality, is an example of the infinite possibilities inherent in negotiation, good will and mutual understanding Among the social items on the agenda of the Assembly, the Dominican Republic considers as being particularly relevant those related to the rights, evolution and development of women as well as to their participation in the political, social and economic life of their countries  In this connection, the new Dominican Government has set up an office for the advancement of women within a Ministry of Social Welfare as a first step towards integration of the different aspects of human advancement  We express our deep satisfaction at the fact that our country has been selected as host to the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women, whose formal installation will take place early next year in Santo Domingo and for which the Dominican Government has already made a substantial appropriation We are confident that the report the Secretary General will submit with regard to this matter, which has already been endorsed by the Economic and Social Council, will prompt other Member States to contribute to the support of this Institute and thereby assure the fulfilment of its important functions Under the present difficult international circumstances, cultural cooperationwidely debated and defined at the World Conference on Cultural Policies, known as MONDIACULT, organized by UNESCO in Augustis evoked to strengthen the ties that exist between peoples  There can be no argument that all cultures have the same dignity and equality; that freedom is necessary to all intellectual and artistic creation; that all patrimonies, be they architectonic, written or oral, need to be protected and that those values are the bedrock of an interdependence freely assumed but carefully preserving identities and receptive to new sources of enrichment The Dominican Republic, which suffered for a long time from cultural isolationism, now wishes to develop communication in education, science, literature and art, provided such dialogues between cultures are established on a basis of respect and reciprocity, of recognition and a receptiveness that assures interchange in the true meaning of that word  We wish to strengthen regional ties, the mutual recognition of cultures, the resources and unique expressions of the peoples of Central America and the Caribbean  To this end, the Dominican Republic has proposed the celebration of the First Biennial of Visual Arts in the Caribbean, to be held in Santo Domingo, a recommendation that was approved by the General Assembly of MONDIACULT However, this wish for a greater closeness to the countries of our region and Latin America does not diminish the lively interest of the Dominican Republic in extracontinental cultural cooperation and the recognition of great historical events of the past that still loom large today  We refer to the fifth centenary of the discovery of America, and we are grateful to the Spanish Foreign Minister for mentioning in his statement the Dominican Republic initiative in proposing that the United Nations General Assembly declare, in a universal context, that be proclaimed the Year of the Fifth Centenary of the Discovery of America The United Nations was founded on the ruins of that great catastrophe that history has called the Second World War  The Organization was conceived to guarantee international peace, to develop friendship among peoples, to assure selfdetermination and to promote, through international cooperation, their social, economic and cultural development  The Organization was conceived in support of human dignity, on the basis of respect for the rights and fundamental freedoms of all mankind without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion  The Organization was conceived to prevent the thirdand probably the lastworld war We often forget that the founders, our predecessors who signed the Charter of San Francisco, did so in the name of peoples, not in the name of States or Governments  This is not a semantic artifice, nor is it a legal subtlety  It is simply the living expression of a deep longing for peace and solidarity that was born in the universal conscience in those dark days  I believe that many of the problems arise or worsen because Governments sometimes ignore the real aspirations of their peoples  People have among themselves spontaneous affinities, natural and pure, that are deeply rooted in their cultural origins and common ideals  Those affinities transcend the boundaries of circumstantial antagonisms that are characteristic of the strict exercise of government  AH Governments, regardless of ideology or of geopolitical location, would render a great service to the Organization vocation for peace should they decide to stimulate the development of those affinities, whose roots are found in the very depth of human awareness  A simple examination of the agenda of the Assembly, a mere study of the multiple conflicts that divide the international community, the anguish expressed by the brave declaration of the Secretary General in his memorable report, will surely prove that we have not yet reached these ideals  However, those harsh realities must not frustrate us to the point of losing faith in the Organization, for if we have not been able in many cases to prevent or to solve conflicts, we have at other times had successes that constitute true triumphs for mankind In this connection, it should be pointed out that if the fear of a nuclear holocaust is still the gravest threat to mankind today, there is no better hope of preventing it than that offered by this exalted forum, open without discrimination or prejudice to all the peoples and nations of the world The imperfections of the Organization must not shatter our faith in it  On the contrary, they Should inspire us to overcome them, thus strengthening our confidence in its capacity to fulfil its objectives  This is the best contribution we can offer to the future of mankind  \\ufeff  I should like at the very outset to express the feeling of admiration and respect with which my country joins in the tribute paid recently to the SecretaryGeneral, Dag Hammarskjold, in his own native land, by all the nations of the free world, a tribute to a man who died tragically in the service of the brightest ideal of modern mankind— that of universal peace and concord  The finest tribute that could be paid to this extraordinary man, this standardbearer of peace, this apostle of brotherhood, would be to have all the nations represented here join selflessly in choosing as his successor someone capable of serving the United Nations with the same lofty spirit of selfsacrifice as he displayed in the cause of furthering the unity and solidarity of the human family  This tribute would also be extended to the great Swedish nation, which has given this world Organization two martyrs: Count Bernadotte, who fell heroically in the deserts of the Middle East, and now Dag Hammarskjold, struck down by the same fatality which has pursued all redeemers since God Himself died on the cross to give us an example of the power of blood to inspire great causes and great human ideals For perhaps the first time in the history of the United Nations, a country of the Americas is reentering this world Organization after having acquired the moral licence to belong to an institution founded precisely to defend the right of man to live in a world free from fear and injustice  The Dominican Republic has been a Member of the United Nations since the Organization inception in  but it is only now, after years of purely theoretical adherence to the principles of the San Francisco Charter, that, in full awareness of its duties and responsibilities, it is really entering this world forum which should count among its Members only those nations for which international agreements are not a myth, and human rights not a fiction  After the fall of the man who for thirty years personified the Dominican State, we established in our country a regime which is based on the rule of law and which has gradually been modelling its institutions on the pattern of representative democracy  Instead of the single party, as we find in countries where political activity is reduced to directives handed down by a totalitarian authority, various competing parties have emerged, parties in which the divergent ideals and desires of the Dominican people have at last found expression, Fundamental civil rights, without which freedom and civil order are inconceivable, have been extended to all citizens who now, after thirtyone years of political obscurantism, freely exercise their constitutional rights and privileges  The iron curtain which encircled the island, and through which independent opinion could scarcely filter, has been lifted, and the right to travel freely has been accorded to three million people who were virtually cut off from international political life and from world civilization  Today, no arbitrary requirements obstruct the issuance of passports and visas to enter and leave Dominican territory  This political realignment of our country with the countries of the free world has been strengthened by the emergence and consolidation of political organizations which carry on their public activities free from arbitrary restrictions, and which fully enjoy the right of peaceful association and the right to elect and to be elected in genuine elections supervised internationally and conducted with exemplary impartiality with the technical help of experts recommended by the secretariat of the Organization of American States  In addition to these decisive steps in the area of political reconstruction, we have taken other no less important steps to promote free enterprise and to rid our economy of all reactionary controls  The monopolies that benefited individuals and the enterprises established to divert much of the nation economic activity towards selfish ends are being eliminated, and the widest freedom is being  restored to business and private initiative  A series of new laws, drafted in a broad spirit of social justice has been enacted to abolish all taxes which in the past weighed heavily on the consumer and made it practically impossible for the poorer classes to subsist  The basic commodities in our export trade have been brought under a new system of duties which channels most of the State revenue towards the farmers The institutional life of the country has been reorganized on a truly liberal basis  Noteworthy accomplishments in this field include the law which restores full administrative authority to municipal councils and reestablishes the unrestricted principle of autonomy of municipal corporations, the law which establishes the independence of the University and reinstates the principle of academic freedom in the oldest institution of higher learning in the Americas; the bill to enforce the constitutional principle of the separation of powers and ensure the tenure of judges and the independence of the judiciary — the basis of civil order in any civilized country; and lastly the laws designed to organize the juridical system and to endow the nation with a political physiognomy of a thoroughly republican character,Thus, a Government based on law is coming into being in the Dominica Republic  The dictatorship has collapsed, and on its ruins we have begun to build, patiently and without demagogic show, a regime cast in the forms which we inherited from the founders of the Republic and which are basically the same as the timehonoured forms fashioned by the creative genius of Bolivar, San Martin, Washington, O'Higgins, Morazon, Juarez, Marti and other great heroes of American independence  This is why I stand here unabashed and speak with a clear conscience and with no fear of offending the memory of my country founding fathers, whose solemn rights we have vindicated and whose unfading legacy we have kept pure as the metal used to case the bells of resurgence  The case of the Dominican Republic is heartening proof that democracy isteadily gaining ground in the Americas and that, despite the poverty which afflicts most of our peoples, despite the distress which ravages our unblessed masses and the difficulties placed by our underdevelopment in the way of our progress towards the high goals of justice, despite all this we are resolutely advancing towards that hardwon ideal achieved in the Americas by only the few nations which can honestly affirm that the lands of the hemisphere are infertile for dictatorship and oppression The openly conducted process of abolishing all our primitive political methods and of liberalizing our institutions is not, of course, proceeding without impediments or limitations  There are negative elements which are opposing this process of democratization with all the ferocity of their barbarian instincts  In addition, the opposition movements which have once more become part of the Republic life lack the necessary civic maturity and frequently transgress the limits of the law, openly violating public order and wilfully disregarding the legitimate authority of the State  The new Government, which in effect emerged after the tragedy of May, for only then was it free of the imperious will which for thirty years weighed heavily on the life of men and institutions, is doing everything in its power to offset these two influences which consciously or unconsciously conspire against the rule of law which we wish to establish for our own sake and for the sake of future generations  The suppressed feelings of rebellion and dissent which the dictatorship bred in the masses of the population have burst loose in the country, shattering the controls imposed by many years of Christian teaching on the populace tormented by long decades of terror  Blood has flowed often, placing its deadly mark on the outbursts of violence, The public rostrum and the balcony overlooking the public square have been used for bitter haranguing and for the flagwaving of professional agitators  But the process has begun, and nothing and nobody can restrain the yearning for political regeneration which is sweeping through the national consciousness with the force of a mighty torrent, It is essential that this political phenomenon should be seen without prejudice and that world public opinion should view it with the sympathy it deserves, as a sincere effort to return an American nation to functional democracy and genuine freedom For over a year the Dominican Republic has been under a severe sentence of banishment which condemns it, like a pestilenceridden country, to economic strangulation and diplomatic ostracism, The Sixth Meeting of Consultation of Foreign Ministers, which met at San Jos Costa Rica, in  meted out a punishment to us upon the justice and propriety of which I shall not dwell for the moment  As everybody knows, we were condemned on that occasion for having interfered in the internal affairs of a sister nation and for having committed a political crime against a distinguished Latin American statesman  I am not denying that that action, in violation of the principle of nonintervention, the bulwark of inter American relations, and that censurable deed which almost cost the life of one of the leaders of hemispheric democracy, deserved to be punished  But it is not fair that the punishment should outlive the culprit and that an institution characteristic of the Stone Age, when the sons were held responsible for the sins of their fathers and the gates of the accursed cities were painted with the stigma INRI, should he written into international law  The action against which sanctions were taken at San Josis a thing of the past  The whole of America rejected it, but failed to appreciate that a sentence condemning a personal act, born of the enmity between two political rivals, cannot be applied to a people and to future generations who were not responsible for it; those who perpetrated or inspired it are now in their graves awaiting the verdict of history Almost at the same time as the Dominican Republic, another Latin American country stood in the prisoner box at San Jose, Costa Rica  The action taken with respect to our country, accused of being a rightist dictatorship and doubtless the most efficient but the most rigid and implacable of all we have known in American in the past century, was exemplary and drastic  But there were no censure or sanctions against the other country, ruled by a leftist dictatorship in which the interest of a foreign Power takes precedence over true interests of the American continent, because such measures were deemed incompatible with the principle of nonintervention and respect for national sovereignty  Now, more than a year later, these contradictions continue to exist and to weaken the faith of our peoples in hemispheric justice and in the effectiveness of the efforts we have exerted for over sixty years to establish inter American relations on a basis of international honour  If only to prevent that difference in the treatment of two small countries situated in the same geographical area from continuing to irritate that sector of Latin American public opinion which is still sensitive enough to protest against the injustice of any discrimination, this monstrous anomaly should be eliminated, WhenI speak of Cuba, I am not censuring that country or challenging its right to determine its own future and to choose its own political institutions  That right is beyond all dispute and it would be absurd to challenge it from the rostrum of an organization which was created precisely in order to defend the self determination of peoples and to restrain the imperialist designs of the great nations of the world  The impassioned figure of Fidel Castro, the sanguinary prophet of the Sierra Maestra, and the nature of his regime, are not matters to be discussed outside the regional context in a world assembly of free nations where it is assumed that every country has the inalienable right to decide freely whether to serve the god of the hammer and the sickle or continue to cast its lot with traditional Christian civilization,This, I feel, is an appropriate time to declare solemnly that the episode for which we were condemned at San Josis a permanently closed chapter in the history of our international relations  The countries represented in this Assembly may be sure that the present Dominican Government will not commit any act which may be regarded as interference, however slight, in matters which come within the sovereignty of other American states  We should also like to declare solemnly and irrevocably in this Assembly that the new Dominican Government henceforth accepts the jurisdiction of the Commission on Human Rights, of the Organization of American States and of the United Nations  Our unreserved acceptance of those organs and of the principles which they represent, as guardians of the inviolable rights of the individual and as guarantors in America and in the world of the dignity of the human person, shall henceforth be judged in the light of events which have occurred or may occur in the Dominican Republic after July  the date which marked the beginning of the lawful State, for whose political and moral solvency we assume responsibility  Following the tragic events of May, there was a period of approximately one month when the Government authorities were virtually powerless to control the wave of reprisals and violence unleashed throughout the country in the confusion created in Dominican society by that overwhelming event  I should make one last statement with regard to this matter in all sincerity and with the same firmness: with or without sanctions, with or without the injustice of San Jose, the Dominican Republic will continue to be unswervingly loyal to the destiny of America, a destiny which is identified with that of the United States so long as the United States fulfils its task of defending the freedom of the world and of safeguarding our civilization, even at the risk of its own survival The political transformation which our country has undergone and the ideology which prevails among its people and in its institutions are the keys to our position with respect to the world problems with which this Assembly is to deal  On each of these questions— prohibition of nuclear weapons, German reunification, elimination of the last vestiges, of colonialism in Africa, the aggressions in Asia Laos, Cambodia, etc — our position can only be one of full support of the Western democracies Having clarified that point, which is so evident as not to require any clarification, X would beg leave to make a few remarks on the problems of my own country, which is as important to America as Laos is to Asia or Nigeria to the future of the African continent It is imperative that the world should follow attentively the events now taking place in the Dominican Republic  The danger of total disintegration which threatens the American 'continent is not in Cuba, which may already be irremediably lost to Western civilization, but in the Dominican Republic, where another crack in the edifice of America might have disastrous consequences for the future of the hemisphere and its collective security  These are not mere conjectures or empty words  Our country is today an unknown factor and its future is surrounded by enigmas  What is brewing there cannot be foreseen or analysed  A people subjected for thirtyone years to one of the most ironfisted dictatorships known in our time is anxiously seeking the way to its final redemption  But there are many elements working against that endeavour in the midst of a particularly difficult and complex situation,The instinct of the masses, who want freedom but confuse it with licence and anarchy, is being frustrated in my country by thirty years of political barbarity  The precarious conditions in which our political stability is being developed are aggravated by economic poverty which, in our country as everywhere, is the great catalyst of social crisis, The whole atmosphere is fraught with explosive factors and revolutionary ferment, Ours is a people which, like all Latin American peoples, has an irrepressible taste for polities and hopes for a better life without any dear idea of how to achieve its goals  The oppressed middleclass, intelligent and ambitious, many of whom have risen by the hard road of a university education, and whose desire to succeed is often frustrated because of lack of opportunities for employment and for earning a livelihood by practising their professions, emphatically condemns poverty and economic injustice, but it suffers from the lack of direction as the working classes Add to that dramatic picture the fact that the whole population is increasing at an alarming rate and that there is not enough employment for about half a million frustrated workers, professional men, students and farmers, who are migrating to the city and being lured by their illusory hopes into its treacherous maw All that social, political and economic disintegration, inherited from a highly constructive dictatorship which was undermined towards the end fey internal disaffection and physical waste, can be exploited by communism to establish another agency of the Kremlin in the American Balkans The opposition political parties and movements have resorted to an intemperate demagogy which has thus far proved incapable of drawing up a programme or of being guided by the principles of constructive action, and the precarious position of the Government, shaken by the constant threat of rebellion and coups d'etat, is creating a special psychology which is preparing the whole island for an almost inevitable upheaval This potentially explosive material, fashioned over thirty years by a totalitarian concept of the economy, human life and social and political relations, is exploited by professional agitators whose objective is not necessarily to seize power, but to prevent the consolidation of any power and the growth of any real democracy within the framework of a Christian and genuinely legal organization of the State,It is essential, therefore, that America should watch what is happening in the Dominican Republic today  The political phenomenon developing there must be observed with true objectivity if communism is to be prevented from piercing that flank of the Caribbean and reaching the very heart of America, that America which should not forget that it was through the Caribbean, through that stormy sea which Humboldt compared to a manymouthed Mediterranean, that the new barbarians, the implacable enemies of American democracy, came to our shores I may have taken more time than my country merits to set forth the case of the Dominican Republic, if we compare its conflicts and interests with the serious problems which the United Nations is called upon to consider and resolve in this Assembly  It is obvious, however, that the future of the Dominican Republic should be of concern not only to America but to this world Organization, which had its origin, so to speak, in that tiny corner of the American continent  America is indebted to my country for countless spiritual treasures  It was in our old university, the oldest in the New World, that the first humanists in America were educated—from the first rector of the University of Caracas, established in  and the first rector of the University of Havana, founded in  to the heroes of the spiritual conquest of America; the descendants of Bishop Ramirez de Fuenleal, founder of the first American school in which Latin grammar was taught, and the men who carried on the humanist tradition of Alejandro Geraldini, who, soon after he came to the island, wrote an ode in classic verse to the first university of the New World  But what the Dominicans can be most proud of is not their labour to nurture the spirit and their old university, full of historic parchments and symbol of the immortal radiance with which the beacons of culture illuminate the races of man  Greater than those honours is the glory of having served as the scene of that crucial event which produced the whole idea of the United Nations, an idea which has been in the process of gestation since the most important concept of modern times penetrated the universal conscience, namely, the concept of the, freedom of the individual For it was precisely among the first generation born to the daughters of Spain, on the ancestral soil of Santo Domingo de la Espaniola, that the vital question of individual liberty, the greatest achievement and the most significant political fact to emerge in the first twenty centuries of the Christian era, was first discussed  That achievement, greater than the exploit of the illustrious navigator who broke through the Pillars of Hercules with the keel of his vessels and whose discovery dispelled the shadows of the dark sea,  was the work of a humble monk, author of the Sermon of the Advent, who was later to work with Francisco de Vitoria, the Spanish Socrates, to embody in public international law the fundamental concept of the inviolability of the rights of the/ individual That missionary was called Fray Pedro de Cordoba and his arrival on the island of Santo Domingo is comparable in the history of America to Saint Paul arrival at Athens, when the idols came crashing down from their pedestals and the cross on the breast of that apostle of human brotherhood opened its arms before all the people to promise men of good will not only that they should inherit the earth, but they should enter the Kingdom of Heaven and of infinite hope  Thus the doctrine on which this world Organization is founded was born in Santo Domingo, for it was there that an illustrious precursor of the great Spanish theologians of the Renaissance first proclaimed the right of everyone, including the aborigines of America, who were still on the fringe of civilization, to enjoy the rights which were thenceforth regarded as superior to any reason of State That assertion, Solemnly proclaimed from the pulpit of an obscure hermitage on the island of Hispaniola, set off the most significant controversy in history  While we have passed judgement on it, we have still not resolved it because the drama of man today, the drama of the United Nations, amounts in essence to a struggle between the right of the individual to enjoy his fundamental rights in full freedom in accordance with the Christian concept of human destiny, and the attempts of totalitarian governments to subjugate him in the name of political logic and social expediency International society, which was still dominated by the spirit of the Middle Ages, with its anachronistic concept of a world divided between two great powers, Church and State, began to undergo basic changes under the influence of the humble Spanish monk who started the crusade in Santo Domingo for the freedom of the indigenous peoples and who enriched jurisprudence from that day forward by introducing a new idealistic and theological concept of the unity of the human family,Before concluding, I should like to take the liberty of recalling from this rostrum the work and the teachings  of those humble missionaries of the old island of Hispaniola, so that the United Nations, guided by the example of that group of religious men who have the honour of having been the first civilisers of the continent, may continue to seek peace, strengthened by faith in God and inspired by the beautiful ideal of human brotherhood A few centuries later, in his address of January  eightyseven years after the United States had won its independence, Abraham Lincoln, an apostolic figure who symbolizes the equality of men and of civic rights, condemned violence, called for reconciliation among his countrymen and urged that all conflicts between peoples should be resolved by righteousness of man and the grace of Almighty God,May his lofty example and the words of his unforgettable address in guide this General Assembly in bringing the ship of peace, now anchored on the shores of the Hudson, into all ports and all continents where the peoples are awaiting it, with the message which will revive the hope which has waned in the hearts of men  \\ufeffOn behalf of the Dominican Republic andits President Mr  Leonel Fernandez Reyna, I wish toconvey to our President our warmest congratulations onhis well deserved election to preside over this fiftysecondsession of the General Assembly, at a time when theOrganization is taking important steps forward in its restructuring and modernization in order to meet thechallenges of peace and economic and social developmentfor our nations Our delegation pays tribute to the outgoingPresident, His Excellency Mr  Razali Ismail, for hisoutstanding conduct of the deliberations during the lastsession of the General Assembly We take this opportunity to express our gratitude tothe SecretaryGeneral, Mr  Kofi Annan, for his assiduity,dedication and hard work in guiding the Organization downa road of reform and modernization that will make itstronger for the new millennium While remaining faithful to the purposes and principlesset forth in the Charter — the maintenance of internationalpeace and security, cooperation for economic, social andcultural development, defence of human rights, andhumanitarian assistance — the United Nations should alsopromote and pursue a reform process which takes intoaccount the many changes that have taken place in acomplex international scene  That scene is marked by theend of ideological confrontations and, at the same time, byincreasing levels of poverty and ethnic and religioustension, phenomena that pose a threat to our supremeobjectives of peace and development for our peoples The trend within the Organization in recent years tothe establishment of working groups, as well as the reportof the SecretaryGeneral entitled “Renewing the UnitedNations: A Programme for Reform”, reflect the strongresolve of Member States to engage in a negotiation andconsultation process that could, once their distrust of thepast is overcome, culminate in farreaching changes in thevarious United Nations bodies  The Dominican Republicattaches special importance to the ongoing reform process,given that it is capable, while respecting the principles andpurposes that gave birth to the Organization, of ensuring amore democratic, transparent, representative and efficientsystem capable of facing the current challenges, especiallythose of peace and the problems of poverty that affect thepeoples of the world In this regard, the strengthening of the GeneralAssembly, the main forum in which Member States arerepresented, cannot be postponed  It is imperative topromote a process of better coordination between theAssembly and the Security Council, so that the Assemblycan be properly informed, and hence make betterrecommendations to the Security Council Aware of the need to strengthen the United Nations,the Dominican Republic calls on this forum to adoptresolutions that can return to the Assembly its capacity asthe governing body of the Organization  In this regard, wewelcome the proposals of the SecretaryGeneral designed tofocus the work of the Assembly on the highestpriorityissues and to reduce the duration of its sessions as well asthe number of agenda items, so as to allow for their indepth study This reorientation should not interfere with theprinciple of sovereign equality, nor with the plural anduniversal character that the Organization has maintainedover the more than half a century of its existence Reaffirmation of the democratic principles contained inthe Charter must constitute the basis for the currentreform process The Dominican Republic proposes the establishmentof mechanisms and working methods that would enablethe Assembly to allow reasonable time for makingprogress on resolving certain conflicts  The problems ofpeace, security and development are multiple andcomplex  However, the commitment of the internationalcommunity expressed in the United Nations should gobeyond merely recalling them each year The aspect of the reform of the Organization that hasraised the greatest debate is the one relating to therestructuring and enlargement of the Security Council Our country hopes that these reforms will promote greaterparticipation by the membership as a whole  Thus, witha more democratic base and a just and equitable selectionprocess, the Council would be in a better position to meetits purposes and objectives  In this regard, the DominicanRepublic proposes the expansion of the Security Councilfrom the current to members  This represents lessthan per cent of the total number of United NationsMember States, whereas in the figure was slightlyabove per cent The Dominican Republic, a founding member of theUnited Nations, has not yet been a member of theSecurity Council  In this new phase of its internationalrelations it has a strong interest in participating activelyin bodies such as the Security Council and thus makinga direct contribution to the maintenance of peace, onwhich depends the very existence of nations An encouraging sign in the proposal of theSecretaryGeneral is that the reforms are constantlyrelated to the achievement of the founding principles ofthe Organization, as expressed in the Charter  Thus, theresults of reform will be assessed primarily not on thebasis of the relationship of costs to benefits, but rather onhow they facilitate the realization of the Organization’sobjectives Our country supports the restructuring of theOrganization as long as it promotes more transparent,clearer and more coherent mandates and is directedtowards finding lasting solutions to the problems ofhunger, underdevelopment, extreme poverty and socialinjustice, not forgetting the mandates related topeacekeeping Allow me to refer to the issue of development  Theincrease in global poverty and the gap between rich andpoor countries is today the crucial problem for theinternational community  Poverty has a negative impact onprogress with regard to peace and security, human rightsand the strengthening of democratic systems  We mustaddress forthwith the challenge posed by the tremendouseconomic and social instability of a large number ofcountries The Dominican delegation associates itself with thedeclarations of the Group of adopted in July of this year,at the twentysecond meeting of the group coordinators,because we support strengthening the role of the UnitedNations in promoting international cooperation for socialand economic development  And we are in favour ofmeasures that will promote the formulation andcoordination of policies and the provision of technicalassistance to developing countries Our country is making serious efforts to position itselffavourably in the world economy and to prepare forglobalization  For this purpose, it is currently conductingmajor economic, monetary, tariff and judicial reforms,while at the same time negotiating freetrade agreementswith countries of the region  Also, together with othercountries, it is formulating strategies to take advantage offunds from multilateral sources The achievements of regional groups such as theCentral American Common Market, the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM), the Andean Group and theSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), amongothers, are indications of the strong willingness of theMember States to expand their capacities and reduce thenegative impact that the new rules of international tradehave on our economies and societies Aware of the commitment to promote at the regionallevel mechanisms for improving economic growth andcombating poverty, the Dominican Republic has in the pastyear strengthened its relations with the countries ofCARICOM and Central America, primarily through theparticipation of our President in the meetings of heads ofState and Government  We are pleased to announce that ourcountry will host the next summit meeting of CentralAmerica, Belize and the Dominican Republic and thatnegotiations for the establishment of a freetrade areabetween CARICOM and the Dominican Republic shouldbe concluded by the end of this year At this time allow me to welcome veryenthusiastically the initiatives of the group of CentralAmerican countries designed to strengthen CentralAmerican unity  It is precisely these efforts that havegiven us faith and confidence in the future of our peoples During this year, the Dominican Republic hasdeveloped a programme for strengthening our links withour neighbouring country, Haiti  For the first time, binational joint commissions are crossing the border to find,through dialogue, areas of mutual interest and solutions tosome of the problems common to both countries Regarding our sister Republic of Haiti, we insist onthe need for the international community to dischargeeffectively the economic commitment it made in with regard to Haiti’s economic recovery anddevelopment  The peacekeeping efforts in Haiti, which wehave promoted in the United Nations, will not besufficient to achieve democratic stability unless they areaccompanied by resources directed to alleviating the greateconomic and social problems affecting that nation We must again emphasize how external debt isweighing down our economies  The onerous costs ofdebtservicing hinder our investing more in our peoples,thus deepening the levels of poverty  For the DominicanRepublic, the payment of outstanding debts and theinterest on them represents nearly per cent of thenational budget  As a means of promoting developmentand social investment projects to combat poverty, we wishto propose to this Assembly that it take the necessaryactions to reduce the burden of the external debt in thosedeveloping countries that have demonstrated a high levelof responsibility in handling their debt We reiterate the commitment of the United Nationsto develop efficient measures for the struggle againstpoverty  Along with peacekeeping, developmentcooperation must constitute an overarching goal of theOrganization  No financing of activities for peacekeeping,the defence of human rights or humanitarian actions willbe sufficient if we do not act responsibly in undertakingmultilateral cooperation for development The proposal to unify the various programmes of theUnited Nations devoted to development seems to us to bea very important step towards the effective coordinationof intersectoral policies, concentrating strategies anddevelopment operations in a United Nations DevelopmentGroup  These initiatives must reorient resources towardareas of priority and achieve better coordination withinternational funding organizations Allow me to express the position of my countryregarding the evolution of the international situation  Peaceis still among the highest aspiration of our peoples Different points of the planet are currently involved inbloody conflicts which affect common citizens  Security istoday not only a matter of the survival of political regimes,but is linked to the very existence of human beings andnature The Dominican Republic expresses its solidarity withthe many conventions of the international communitydevoted to eradicating corruption, terrorism, drug traffickingand money laundering  These evils disrupt the lives of ourpeoples, erode our institutions and prevent the strengtheningof democracy We reiterate our conviction regarding the defence ofdemocratic principles and institutionality  In this regard, mycountry is making tremendous efforts to reform andmodernize the State and the judicial system  Establishingmeans of promoting a transparent public administration,controlling all forms of administrative corruption, is amongthe ongoing processes in our nation  Dialogue and thesearch for consensus among the branches of the State andbetween the executive branch and civil society have becomethe polestar of public administration of the DominicanGovernment The Dominican Republic welcomes and associatesitself with the measures taken by the United Nations toextend the presence of the peacekeeping forces in Haiti Their presence, we believe, strengthens the possibilities fordemocratic stability and will allow the people to take suresteps on the road towards consolidating the country’sdemocracy We stress the need for a definitive and peacefulsolution to the conflict in the Balkans, and we call upon theinternational community to strengthen its efforts to achievepeace in the Middle East  The crisis in that region, whichhas deteriorated in recent months, demands specialattention  We call for respect for all the agreements signedin recent years in order to restore peace in the region With regard to the Republic of China on Taiwan, theDominican Republic reiterates its position as presented byour President, Dr  Leonel Fernandez Reyna, regarding theneed for the international community to consider theimportance of that country, owing to its geographicallocation and given the fact that security and stability areof great significance for the peace and prosperity of theregion  We call for a constructive dialogue between thetwo sides of the Strait of Taiwan in search of mutualunderstanding and cooperation  We reiterate that parallelparticipation of both countries in the United Nationswould contribute to the maintenance of peace Our country supports the efforts under way invarious international conferences in Brussels, Oslo, andvery soon in Ottawa, regarding the process to achieve atotal ban an antipersonnel landmines  The commitmentto peace is a commitment to life  The internationalcommunity has an obligation to promote peace and todefend life in all situations and circumstances The Dominican Republic, traditionally a peaceoriented nation, does not produce or consume nuclearenergy for military purposes; it utilizes such energy forpeaceful purposes  In this spirit, the Dominican Presidentsigned the Comprehensive NuclearTestBan Treatyduring his visit to the United Nations last year Various international conferences are currentlydiscussing conventions on the use of nuclear energy  Oneof them is the convention to regulate the harm caused topersons and the environment by radioactive waste  TheDominican Republic depends to a large extent on tourism,a tourism of beaches and sun  The quality of our coastalwaters is vital for the sector’s development, and anyinternational radioactivityrelated damage can mean thecollapse of this important sector of our economy  Weappeal to the good judgement of the internationalcommunity to preserve our natural resources We reaffirm our commitment to the protection of theenvironment and natural resources  In this spirit, ourcountry has acceded to the United Nations InternationalConvention to Combat Desertification The Dominican Republic reiterates its commitmentto defending and protecting human rights  In thisconnection, it welcomes the efforts made by the UnitedNations to concentrate the activities of the Office of theHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and the Centre forHuman Rights  During this year we have had thesatisfaction of receiving two international missions onhuman rights, invited by our Government  A HighLevelMission of the InterAmerican Committee on HumanRights (ICHR), of the Organization of American States,visited the country in June, and a mission of the Committeeof the International Covenant on Economic, Social andCultural Rights of the United Nations, with headquarters inGeneva, is in the country at this very moment  These visitsindicate the Government’s interest in ensuring transparencyof action to defend and protect human rights in theDominican Republic Allow me to refer to the situation of the UnitedNations International Research and Training Institute for theAdvancement of Women  Our country wishes to reiteratethe mandate given in Economic and Social Councilresolution of May  in which it is clearlyand explicitly stated that the headquarters of the Institutewould be established in the Dominican Republic, adeveloping country The objectives that led to the creation of the Instituteare still valid today  Research and training for the purposeof creating new ways for women to contribute to thedevelopment of their countries, in the light of women’sneeds, are a priority  This concern was manifested at theBeijing Conference of and in the Platform for Actionto follow up the agreements reached in that importantforum In order to cooperate with the United Nations, theDominican Government not only donated the buildinghousing the Institute but also invested large amounts ofmoney to renovate the building and adapt it to theInstitute’s needs  This explains our surprise when, in the United Nations Secretariat proposed the merger of theInstitute and the United Nations Development Fund forWomen (UNIFEM), without prior consultation with ourGovernment and ignoring the headquarters agreement However, in the Fourth World Conference onWomen, in its Beijing Platform for Action, confirmed theInstitute’s mandate We hope that in the process of United Nations reformall the mandates approved by the Member States will beequally respected, since these States bear sole responsibilityfor renewing or changing decisions adopted by the GeneralAssembly Lastly, we welcome the summoning of Member Statesto reflect on and endorse these transformations in our worldOrganization  The Assembly of the millennium proposed tous for the year would be an unprecedented forum forevaluating what we have done on the road to these reformsand for reiterating our tremendous faith and trust in thefuture of the generations of the twentyfirst century At this fiftysecond session of the General Assemblywe are faced with the historic responsibility of givinggreater reality to our hopes and expectations for a betterfuture for humankind  The changes in those realities aretaking place faster than the changes in the structures wehave given ourselves for dealing with them  We have aunique opportunity to ensure that the reforms of theOrganization respond to the expectations of a UnitedNations that is in line with the needs of the new age  I should like first to express my personal satisfaction and that of my delegation at the unanimous election of Mr  Belaúnde as President of this session of the General Assembly  His election not only recognizes his personal influence, which has been felt in the United Nations ever since it was founded at San Francisco, but is also welldeserved tribute to his country, which has contributed so greatly to the development of international law and culture in America and as such is a source of profound satisfaction to all the Latin American countries  Our ideals of peace and justice in international relations have found in Mr  Belaúnde, with his brilliant intelligence, his scholarship, backed by solid religious and moral convictions and his moving eloquence, an outstanding champion in each of the phases in the history of our Organization which he so admirably described in his speech of acceptance [h meeting]  May I add my good wishes for the success of his work in the high office he now occupies Once again the General Assembly is meeting to review what has been achieved and to initiate new efforts in the cause of peace and collective security, the most serious and urgent problem of our time and the raison d’être of the United Nations In its exposition of the function of the main organs and in guiding principles of the United Nations, the Charter clearly established what might be described as the factors of peace and international security  The pacific settlement of international disputes, the development of respect for the principle of equal rights and selfdetermination of peoples, the control and ultimate elimination of the armaments race, the solution of problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, the promotion of social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom — these are the conditions that must be satisfied if we are to attain the goals to which mankind’s hopes for peace and security are directed In the case of each of these conditions of peace and security, the means to be employed depend on the goal to be attained  In the case of some of them it is clear that the full exercise of the functions of the United Nations organs is the only appropriate approach  But, although that approach might seem equally applicable to every question covered by the Charter, there are some cases in which it would not attain the desired end  For example, in the case of matters that bear directly on the existence of a State, its political system and its social and economic organization, such efforts would fail and would moreover be contrary to the principle of the Organization embodied in Article  paragraph  of the Charter  Whatever the importance of the various items handed down to us from previous sessions of the Assembly, including some of the questions most nearly affecting the cause of peace, such as disarmament, the development of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, it is evident that the arms race is an effect or a symptom rather than the cause of the tensions in international life today  In the opinion of my delegation and country international tension has its roots in the' fear and mistrust implanted in the minds of the free nations of the world by the onslaught of a militant and dogmatic ideology whose real danger lies not in its economic and social methods or its nihilistic attitude to certain spiritual values which we cannot renounce, but in its subversive tendencies, in its revolutionary and uncompromising solutions of political and social problems, insofar as it seeks to impose them on the rest of the world, and in the persistent threat it offers to the independence and sovereignty of States  International communism, by systematically extending its influence in a manner disturbing to the orderly progress of the international community, is the most important factor in the political tensions that divide the world into what have hitherto been two irreconcilable camps  It is this danger, this constant threat of aggression, that has given rise to the arms race, a psychology that makes the positions of the two sides mutually incomprehensible, and the allocation to national defence needs of resources that could be better employed in promoting the great economic, social, cultural and humanitarian aims of the United Nations The Government of the Dominican, Republic believes that it can best contribute to the cause of peace by strengthening its internal and external security, opposing any act of aggression, consolidating its traditional alliances with the great Powers of the free world, and supporting the fundamental aims of the United Nations, which constitute the best guarantee of the peaceful coexistence of all nations It has been frequently said that peace and international security are not a monopoly or exclusive responsibility of the great Powers  Certainly the smaller nations must not be content with playing the role of a Greek chorus  If international public opinion is a factor of importance in international relations today, it is here in the General Assembly of the United Nations that it is acquiring growing powers of persuasion and greater influence over the destiny of the world It is in this Assembly, where newly created nations come as sovereign States to solemnize, as it were, their new status, that we should vigorously and clearly proclaim our belief that the sovereignty and independence of States are sacrosanct and that only through respect for the dignity of these prerogatives can international cooperation and progress towards the ultimate goals of the United Nations be achieved For all these reasons, the great problem which underlies the various items on our agenda, and which the great Powers in particular will have to consider in exploring the possibilities of agreements to advance the cause of peace, is the creation of a climate of confidence and a real clarification of intentions and, objectives, going far beyond the mere dogmatic affirmations of a belief in peace not borne out by the facts, My delegation sincerely hopes that the exchanges of views which have taken place between two great Powers in whose hands the fate of the world largely rests may prove successful and not be as fruitless as the socalled Geneva spirit of Some of the speakers who have preceded me at this rostrum have underlined the importance of the observance by all States of the principle of freedom of communication  May I say that my country fully shares that concern  If there is one field in which our interdependence as nations is abundantly clear, it is in the field of communications, which, of course, include maritime as well as aerial, radio and telephone communications It has been said that any material or intellectual interchange between States and the inhabitants of States presupposes means of communication  The right of communication is therefore from the sociological point of view the sine qua non of international life  Such is the importance of communications in the life of the international community that any measure to restrict or suspend them by the individual and arbitrary decision of a State is an act of such gravity that it might be considered a violation of Article  paragraph  of the Charter of the United Nations, since such action is an enforcement measure that can only be validly taken by the competent organs of the international community, such as the Security Council of the United Nations under Article of the Charter The cooperation of the Dominican Republic with the United Nations is expressed in our direct collaboration with the Organization and with those regional and specialized agencies of which we are a member, as well as in our national policy  The policy of the Dominican Republic is based on the conviction that the United Nations constitutes an indispensable instrument in the evolution of international relations towards the establishment of a truly international society  Relations between States in the world today would be inconceivable without a universal organization of the scope of the United Nations  If it did not exist it would have to be created  Its existence at the present time constitutes one of the best guarantees for the rational conduct of international affairs My Government is deeply interested in all efforts at the international level to ensure the most effective possible implementation of collective security; it has supported the United Nations Emergency Force and has contributed its proportional share towards the maintenance of that Force since  I am happy to state that it will continue this policy and will support at the present session any measure that will ensure the effectiveness of this important instrument for the maintenance of peace and collective security The Dominican Republic has also made substantial contributions to other United Nations activities directed to urgent humanitarian ends, and has for example contributed a total sum of $for the assistance of refugees, through the various agencies concerned, first the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees, later the International Refugee Organization and more recently the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Our participation in UNICEF dates back to the establishment of that great instrument for humanitarian action, to which we have made contributions totalling $ and last month we contributed a further $for the continued support of its programmes We have also maintained regular and substantial participation in the technical assistance programme of the United Nations One of the most striking features of the present century in international relations has been the emergence of new States in the international community and in the United Nations  My Government and country are not indifferent to the movement which in Asia and Africa is initiating a process similar to that which in the nineteenth century culminated in the emergence of the American States as part of the international community  This process is giving effect to one of the highest goals of the United Nations, and my Government, which endeavours to establish friendly relations with countries where this national consciousness is awakening — as was shown by the recent exchange of visits of high officials of the Government of the Dominican Republic and of the Republic of Liberia — views such aspirations with sympathy, while maintaining at all times the balanced and conciliatory stand it has always taken in the discussion of questions concerning the transition from a nonselfgovernment or international trusteeship to statehood and independence I should like to refer now to another aspect of the Dominican Government’s policy of cooperation with the United Nations, that of this polity’s repercussions at the national level  The Charter recognizes in Article  paragraph  that one of the Organization’s purposes is to serve as a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends, and it follows that efforts must be made first of all within the nations themselves to attain the principal objectives of the United Nations and particularly those relating to economic, social and cultural development and the protection of human rights and of fundamental freedoms for all without distinction of race, sex, language or religion  This individual role of each State in furthering United Nations purposes is laid down in Article  which forms part of one of the most remarkable chapters of the United Nations Charter — Chapter IX, relating to international economic and social cooperation — and which makes clear the obligation of all Member States to take both joint and separate action to achieve the objectives set forth in that Chapter There exists a line of propaganda, based on deliberate and crass ignorance of presentday conditions in the Dominican Republic, which maliciously, represents my country’s Government as violating basic constitutional standards with regard to human rights  According to this same propaganda we ought also to apologize for the length of time the political party which guides the destinies of the Dominican Republic has been in power  The reproach would certainly be justified if it could be shown that the period of nearly three decades in which that party has been in power was a period in which the Dominican nation had made no progress, a period of regression, backwardness and decadence in the life of the Dominican people  We realize that every Government is born with its historical responsibilities and that it is precisely the regime whose actions are inspired by its consciousness of those responsibilities which will endure, for in political affairs no form of government can be maintained in a vacuum or can prosper in negation or if it is incapable of fulfilling its people’s desires and demands What is certain is that during the first decades of this century it became obvious that we in the Dominican Republic had to overcome the economic, social and cultural prostration caused by our troubled history and that a programme of national recuperation must be heroically undertaken and implemented  Until  our history was shaped by the incongruity between the principles set forth in our Constitutional Charter and the reality of underlying economic and social conditions  With the extent of our national territory undetermined because of centurylong failure to solve the boundary problem, with the collapse of our financial structure and the ensuing bankruptcy and compromising of our national sovereignty, with our population decimated by endemic diseases which undermined its productive capacity, sunk in the depths of ignorance and existing precariously in a primitive economy, the Dominican nation had to face a battle with lost time which required an intense effort of political unity in order to ensure the fullest participation of all Dominicans in the fight for riches, wellbeing and progress It is obvious that under those conditions we could hardly be a factor of international cooperation  In  our territorial boundaries were fixed by the Additional Boundary Protocol, supplemented by our policy of Dominicanization of the frontier; and in  at a time when we were compelled to incur considerable expenditures for defence in order to confront a subversive coalition, we completely redeemed the Dominican international debt with the payment of $ Economic, social and cultural indexes register the progressive development achieved by successive administrations under the same unified political direction — and the following positive results have been achieved As economic matters have acquired greater importance in the deliberations of the major interAmerican conferences, one of the problems which has rightly been considered as fundamental  in any scientific economic planning is the problem of land tenure  In more than one Latin American country, agrarian reform is one of the highest aspirations of social progress  If the Dominican Republic has today succeeded in multiplying the national budget of about $million by fifteen and the indexes of Dominican per caput income by a similar amount, it may be affirmed that this state of affairs is the result of vast agrarian reforms achieved in our country by means of a series of measures beginning with the parcelling of the land, the distribution of seeds and farm equipment, vocational schools, rural medical care, construction of irrigation canals representing an investment of more than $million and kilometres long with an irrigable capacity of more than “tareas”, that is, about hectares, experimental farming stations, the construction of communications, and, lastly, the establishment of banking institutions specialized in financing agricultural and industrial undertakings  Land distribution statistics show that between  when the Dominican agrarian reform programme was begun, and  more than million tareas” were distributed among farmers  The results of this agrarian reform can be better appreciated when it is considered that the annual production of the agricultural groups which before was only worth $ in the last sevenyear period reached $million, to the exclusive benefit of the farmers, who in obtained exclusive ownership of their lands in accordance with Act No   dated June of that year In order to give a rough idea of the stage reached by Dominican education in recent times, it is sufficient to point out that, while our population has doubled in the last twentytwo years, primary school facilities during the same period have been increased elevenfold  There are pupils registered in country and city schools, teenagers attending secondary schools and being trained in vocational schools  The University of Santo Domingo, whose glorious tradition dates back to  the year of its foundation, and which played so outstanding a role during the American colonial era, has today a registration of more than pupils and has seven faculties and five specialized institutes or schools  The culmination of this effort is the Trujillo Campaign for Total Literacy, the effectiveness of which is demonstrated by the fact that, although the illiteracy index in was per cent, it has today been reduced to per cent  That is why Mr  R  Barón Castro at the Third IberoAmerican Congress on Education, held at Ciudad Trujillo in October and November  stated on behalf of the Executive Board of UNESCO that illiteracy in the Dominican Republic had decreased sharply As regards health and social security, there are over hospitals, maternity homes, sanatoria, and private clinics in all parts of the Republic  There are thirtytwo dietetic and child nutrition establishments, and savings institutions and educational cooperatives have been organized in eighty establishments The Dominican policy as regards human rights has been implemented through a body of laws and institutions which achieved their highest expression in the Dominican constitutional reform of  whereby the State’s principal aim was recognized as being the effective protection of human rights and the establishment and maintenance of means which would enable human beings to make steady progress within a framework of freedom and social justice compatible with public order, the general welfare and universal rights, This fundamental principle has been supplemented by the new concept of a modern constitutional system represented by the provisions on economic and social rights which are contained in one of the Covenants on Human Rights being prepared by the Commission on Human Rights and which have been embodied in the present Dominican Constitution In the introduction to his annual report on the  work of the Organization, the SecretaryGeneral refers to the activities envisaged by the United Nations Charter which, although not carried out directly by United Nations organs, are nevertheless linked by the Charter to the tasks of our Organization  With reference to the recommendations made in Article  regarding the Security Council, that the Council should take into account any procedure which the parties may have adopted in order to settle a dispute, he expresses the opinion that this rule has been understood to have reference especially to efforts on a regional basis or through regional organizations like the Organisation of American States [A/Add  p  ,The Dominican delegation considers that the regional organizations, far from detracting from the importance and predominance of the United Nations in the sphere of international relations, are in a position to carry out a complementary mission of the greatest importance since, with the continual advent of new sovereign and independent entities in international life, new regional communities of States are being formed and the world Organization volume of work is increasing The Government of the Dominican Republic has always pursued a policy of peace in its international relations, particularly with those countries with which it is geographically and historically linked  A striking demonstration of that policy was the solution of the centurylong boundary dispute with its neighbour, the Republic of Haiti, by the signature of the Additional Boundary Protocol of  The Dominican Republic peaceful disposition is also evidenced by its ratification of all the legal instruments on the maintenance of peace in America, among them the most perfect of all, the American Treaty on Pacific Settlements, signed at Bogota in which makes the fullest provision for the settlement of international disputes by legal procedures The Dominican Government has always been very respectful of whatever measures for the peaceful settlement of international disputes have been proposed to it  Although a zealous defender of the sovereignty for which it has had to fight so hard, it is also respectful of the sovereignty of others  Hence we must place on record our categorical rejection of the allegations made in a statement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs off the Republic of Cuba that the Dominican Republic is a centre of revolutionary operations against the Cuban regime  The events responsible for the international tensions in the Caribbean are too recent for anyone to try to startle this plenary meeting with accusations which only rebound against their authors  It was, in fact, from Cuban territory that the aggressive expedition which arrived in the Dominican Republic on and June set out with the purpose of unleashing a civil war, but they were completely annihilated by the Dominican armed forces with the effective cooperation of the rural population — an unequivocal demonstration of the essential popularity of Dominican political institutions After this involuntary digression, I should like to refer to an event destined to exercise a major influence on the development of interAmerican relations  Operation PanAmerica, justly praised by those representatives of American nations who have spoken before me, is in the tradition of Americanism with which Brazilian diplomacy is identified  Although it expresses the interests and aspirations of the Latin American half of the American partnership, the reception given by the United States Government to the initiative of the President of Brazil, Mr  Kubitschek, is also worthy of high praise  I had occasion to emphasize the importance of this initiative in the Assembly at its thirteenth session {t meeting}, on the eve of the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers at Washington, at which a new interAmerican economic policy was devised  The most practical achievement of which has been the setting up of the InterAmerican Development Bank for the purpose of stimulating economic development in Latin America  The significance of Operation PanAmerica is that continental solidarity is one and indivisible like its destiny  It means, in accordance with the guiding principle of the diplomacy which gave it birth, that American relations must be adjusted in action and spirit to form a perfect unity conceived on the basis of mutual respect among all the States of the American community  It means that any idea of antagonistic blocs or of exclusive groups is contrary to the best interests of a united America  It implies lastly that, without economic and social solidarity, American solidarity wot\\\\|d break down in an atmosphere of disagreement and discouragement likely to stimulate those influences which seek to draw the American economy into the orbit of a policy based on the principles of dialectical materialism and class struggle transferred into the field of international relations  The dire consequences of such an orientation are easily foreseeable  Because we share the conviction of those who believe that the historical community of America has a wealth of spiritual and material resources to develop, in the spirit of our traditions, which are based on Western Christian thought, the most outstanding example of regional international cooperation in the spirit of Chapter DC of the Charter, the Dominican delegation would like to congratulate the Government of Brazil on its magnificent contribution to the cause of American unity The Dominican delegation hopes most sincerely that this session of the Assembly, continuing in the significant tradition of previous sessions — so well embodied in our President, Mr  Belaúnde — will prove worthy of the hopes of mankind and of the noble leadership which he has demonstrated in the United Nations, so that the fourteenth session of the Assembly will go down in history as the harbinger of peace and conciliation  It is a pleasure for my delegation, Mr  President, to offer you its congratulations on the honour which the Assembly has conferred on you and your country by appointing you to preside over the work of the present session  The experience you have demonstrated in similar capacities in other United Nations organs and in other posts, and your ability, prudence and other qualities are undoubtedly an assurance of success in your present duties My delegation is also happy to welcome to this Organization the new States of Malawi, Malta and Zambia, which have come to take on and to share the heavy responsibilities imposed on all Members of the United Nations by its Charter  The admission of these Members to the Organization is a further step on the way to decolonization, and the fact that when the Charter was signed in there were fiftyone Members, whereas today the original number has more than doubled, with African nations predominating among the new Members, shows how much progress has been made The remarks of the Dominican Republic on this occasion and at this stage of the general debate will, in view of the present circumstances, necessarily be very brief and be confined to some aspects of the problems which most directly concern it within the framework of the United Nations  Before taking these up, however, we must express our hope and earnest wish that the difficulties  which the Organization is now facing may be dealt with in a realistic spirit and be satisfactorily overcome, so that its existence and authority may be reaffirmed and it may carry out the task assigned to it in the preamble of the Charter, for the good of mankind  It is hardly necessary for me to say that the United Nations must be preserved at all costs and regardless of the sacrifices involved and that we must all do our utmost to preserve it, since it is our common heritage built up over the centuries in an endeavour to find a formula enabling people to live together in peace and understanding  Now that the formula has been found, we must take advantage of it and prevent it from being thwarted The Dominican Republic is doing everything in its power to give its people, abandoned for many years to a harsh fate, an awareness of the freedom they had been denied and the means to overcome the economic atrophy which was their lot for more than three decades and has been aggravated by the world situation of today  The progress, as yet rudimentary, already achieved has been due to the goodwill and patriotism of their present leaders and to the initiative of the Dominican people themselves, also, in a particular way, to cooperation from outside sources, among which the technical assistance agencies of the United Nations and’ the Alliance for Progress have played a large part  By its own efforts and with the assistance which it hopes it will continue to receive, the Dominican Republic will inevitably overcome its economic difficulties both for its own benefit and for the sake of other areas in the same region which, lacking adequate natural resources, cannot but profit from any progress made by the Dominican Republic One of the most serious problems that is already having an alarmingly apparent impact on the country economic and social wellbeing and is aggravating its underdevelopment is population growth, which, although a matter of concern in Latin America as well as elsewhere, is assuming unusual features in the Dominican Republic  Even today the Dominican economy produces barely enough food to supply a population of about million, which, within the short space of no more than twenty years, will be doubled  The prediction of Malthus, with all its attendant calamities, is being fulfilled in the Dominican Republic, for while the population appears to be increasing in rapid geometrical progression, the same is not true of the means of subsistence, which appear to have remained stationary or, at best, to be increasing in arithmetical progression  The consequences which such a situation portends are easy to imagine This grave problem, the dimensions of which were pointed out by SecretaryGeneral Thant in his report to this Assembly [A/, has been tackled by the Dominican Government, which intends to solve it not merely by resorting to mechanical or artificial processes of doubtful applicability and efficacy but by employing scientific methods of positive economic value  Accordingly, the Dominican Government, with the help of United Nations technical assistance in conjunction with the facilities of the Alliance for Progress, is at present studying a programme for developing the basins of two of the largest rivers in the Republic  The waters of these rivers will be used to irrigate what is virtually barren land and convert it into a vast source of agricultural products and to produce hydroelectric power so that not only will the present and future food problem be solved, but the general economic progress of the country will be furthered through a rise in per capita income far beyond present or prospective levels  This project, as is obvious, is directly related to the United Nations Development Decade Against this background, the Dominican Republic reaffirms its decision to support all the measures proposed on the occasion of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, held at Geneva from March to June  and will do everything in its power to ensure their complete and prompt implementation  The application of some of these measures will make a direct contribution to solving the economic problems of the Dominican Republic as well as of other developing countries  Such measures will call for discarding habits of long standing, and this will mean sacrifices which the Dominican people, let it be said in their favour, are prepared to accept in the hope of achieving a better standard of living and of removing the internal tensions which poverty and social injustice inevitably create,A good omen of the success of the measures suggested or proposed at Geneva is the solidarity of the developing countries as reflected in the Group of Seventyseven, which, let it be said in passing, must, in its membership or composition, be based on the principle of complete universality or be a union of all the poorer countries having the same objective of achieving better economic conditions With regard to strictly internal matters, the present Government has undertaken to maintain order and the institutions of the Republic in the service of the people and to protect fundamental freedoms  Freedom of the Press and all other human rights are enjoyed by all the Dominican people, who will have the opportunity next September of going to the polls in order to legitimize their country constitutional status by installing in office a freely elected democratic government With regard to the purely international order, my Government reiterates and reaffirms its traditional policy of respect for international obligations and zeal for peace  It therefore confirms its adherence to the principles and standards of the United Nations Charter in their full scope and breadth and to the agreements, norms, decisions and opinions emanating from its organs, in particular from the International Court of Justice  My delegation is accordingly in a position to announce that the Dominican Government will ratify General Assembly resolutions A and B (XVUI), which make provision for the enlargement of the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council  It will also maintain its declared position with regard to the Republic of China and will therefore reaffirm that country right to occupy the place which properly belongs to it in the Organization With regard to the problem of disarmament and related problems, the problem of selfdetermination and its corollary, decolonization, and the problem of apartheid and all forms of discrimination, my Government strongly reaffirms its determination to cooperate in the removal of the conditions which give rise to such problems The desire of all peoples to live in peace is particularly noticeable in the developing countries, because without peace their striving for economic progress will be blocked  Peace, however, presupposes a juridical order of respect for the norms established and created by law  Within the international community such a juridical order is ensured by the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations  Without the United Nations the world would inevitably revert to an era of temporizing between the great Powers and the States dependent on them, that is to say, to a situation containing the seeds of war  In order to prevent ourselves from falling into such a state of affairs, which would be fatal for the smaller states, we must ensure that the United Nations continues in existence and preserves its prestige and effectiveness We therefore believe that an opportunity to make these principles and ideas live, to restore their full force and to propagate them among all the nations of the world is being offered to us in this year, which has been designated International Cooperation Year [see resolution (XVIII), a year in which the activities of all the countries represented in this Assembly should and must be inspired by a desire to reduce tension by halting the arms race, by continuing the dialogue between the industrialized and the developing Powers, by eliminating colonialism and discriminatory policies and by determining to resolve disputes between nations by peaceful means  In response to the unanimous sentiments of the people of the Dominican Republic, my Government comes for the seventh time to this General Assembly in order to give further evidence of its firm resolve to contribute unwaveringly and unconditionally by every means at its disposal to the efforts made by the United Nations in the difficult task of attempting through conciliation and agreement to find a just solution of the many problems and disputes that have been submitted to it for consideration and decision  These problems and disputes reflect the most varied aspects of the serious social and political crisis through which our generation is passing m these difficult times, and they confront the world with the terrible threat of war and destruction  Our participation in the noble work of the General Assembly is based, as always, upon an imperative desire for international cooperation  That we are able to realize that desire is the result of one of the most outstanding victories of contemporary civilization in the field of international law, namely, the final and complete recognition of the equal sovereignty of States, irrespective of their military strength or the extent of their territories We in the Dominican Republic are convinced that this fundamental principle of equality, which unites in this Assembly the community of the nations of the world on the basis of their common right to participate in the examination and discussion of problems and points of disagreement and, consequently, in the taking of decision designed to settle such matters, can and should be a sufficient stimulus to the creation and strengthening of an unshakeable faith that this eminent body can ensure a progressive implementation of the principles of international law and the supremacy of justice which will eventually make it possible for confidence and mutual respect to prevail in relations between States  This is the only way which will assuredly lead to the foundation of the hopedfor world of peace in which all peoples have equal rights to pursue their respective destinies in fitting conditions of wellbeing, their spiritual expansion unhampered In this urgent task of achieving international peace and security, it is the General Assembly which, by a kind of positive and praiseworthy development, has become the leading organ of the united Nations  Because the Assembly is indisputably competent to deal with the essential problems of the maintenance of peace and to seek practical formulae for the cooperation of States in economic and social matters, the Assembly is in itself the strongest guarantee of the effectiveness and permanence of the United Nations When it made a careful and patient examination of the long list of items on the agenda of the present session, my Government, like that of all nations which love peace and order, was never for a moment unaware of the almost insurmountable difficulty inevitable and relentlessly arising in connexion with every problem before the General Assembly, due to the continued misunderstanding of certain governments whose selfish interests, sharpened by ideological zeal, lead them to reduce all their arguments to vituperation and slander and whose totally intransigent attitude in most cases frustrates or disappoints the most legitimate hopes for a speedy settlement of disputes and the successful outcome of that high endeavour which it is the duty of the United Nations to make in order to lead the peoples of the world towards true progress Thus, the course of the very serious events in Korea, the questions of Tunisia and Morocco, the restoration of Austrian sovereignty and independence, the repatriation of Gr eek children, the international regulation of armed forces and armaments, collective measures to ensure peace and security, and, finally, the question of the admission of new Members — to mention but a few of the items for our consideration — are all questions which, given present political circumstances and independently of their own characteristics and peculiarities, are unfortunately and inevitably dominated by considerations which are/ strictly speaking, alien to them and which can in no way contribute to a correct assessment of their elements, in accordance with a true and unrestricted adherence to the purposes and principles freely and unanimously adopted at San Francisco The delegation of the Dominican Republic will, as it has always done, support the efforts of those who understand and admit that, whatever the obstacles, the General Assembly, in response to the urgent appeal of international public opinion, must fulfil the high purposes which explain and justify the existence of our Organization, My delegation will unhesitatingly approve all solutions which, while ensuring respect for and proper application of the basic principles of international law, particularly those principles set forth and enshrined in the letter and spirit of the Charter, ensure also, in accordance with the relevant provisions, both the inviolability of the domestic jurisdiction of States and the faithful observance of international obligations voluntarily assumed   I shall take this opportunity to reiterate our conviction that if we could succeed in achieving unity of mind and effort with regard to methods of collective action which might be used to maintain and strengthen international peace and security, all, or nearly all, the political problems before the General Assembly might, solely by virtue of that important agreement, find, speedy and appropriate solutions Likewise, on the question of the admission of new Members, we wish to reaffirm our belief in the universality of the United Nations  An obvious paradox arises whenever there is a refusal to admit peaceloving peoples who respect the principles of the Charter; such exclusion limits the scope — which is necessarily universal — of our Charter, to the detriment of the peoples so arbitrarily deprived of the benefits of the cooperative action which is proceeding with increasing effectiveness within our Organization In the same way, we naturally give our full attention to economic and social matters  These have greater possibilities than political matters, and there is no doubt that they offer more encouragement to hope and to believe in a reconciliation of views leading to the restoration of tranquility and the final achievement of peace  In this connexion, it would be no exaggeration to state that if we can find some positive means to promote the real development of economically underdeveloped nations, we shall have taken an enormous step forward towards the fulfilment and realization of the high purposes of the international community  That is our main reason for approving any proposal which, like the proposal for the establishment of an international finance corporation [E/ now under preparation by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is designed to settle the most urgent needs for capital, which is often difficult to obtain in the open money market, the object being to promote the healthy economic expansion of the underdeveloped countries by rendering possible the establishment and consolidation of undertakings which will ensure a substantial increase in their productivity Given the increasing interdependence of the different parts of the contemporary world, all questions directly related to the international circulation and distribution of wealth, and in particular to the equitable distribution of exportable products from the countries in process of development, are just as important as the question of increasing the productive capacity which is required to ensure the economic development of nations which have hitherto been less favoured — a most urgent task, This will explain the support which we are prepared to give to any step which, in connexion with item of the agenda, referring to the economic development of underdeveloped countries or with any of the items considered annually by the Second Committee, would lead to the inclusion, as a permanent item, in the agenda of the General Assembly of a periodic study of problems specifically arising from the expansion of international trade  That would enable the General Assembly, as the supreme executive organ of the United Nations, to outline or help to outline the overriding principles which should serve as a basis for international policy in this matter, reconciling the difficulties arising from a lack of flexibility in the import markets of the industrialized countries with the legitimate concern of growing nations that their exportable products should be  properly absorbed by those markets  By this means, the General Assembly and the competent organs of the United Nations would be able to open up impressive opportunities for the development of trade, and accordingly for a rapid rise in the standard of living of all the peoples of the world, disposing of the problems and the risks at present involved in the fair distribution of resources and exportable surpluses, such problems being an obvious impediment to the progress of nations which are endeavouring to reach economic maturity and an open insult to the peoples who are directly contributing to the creation of wealth by their efforts and sacrifices In the honourable tradition of American international legal thought, we may, as a justification for our proposals, refer to our profound devotion to the principle which has long prevailed in interAmerican affairs, that the economic security indispensable for the progress of all peoples is at any time the best guarantee of their political security and of the success of their joint efforts for the maintenance of peace  No other convictions but these have inspired and continue to inspire the Government of the Dominican Republic in planning and embarking on the implementation of one of the most outstanding and complete programmes of economic rehabilitation ever attempted in Latin America  Allow me to say, with proper patriotic pride, that it has also been one of the most fruitful and most productive of benefits for our people The policy of agrarian reform and industrialization which my Government is pursuing, with the intention of progressively meeting the needs of our people while enabling them to purchase a greater quantity of the foreign products that are required to expand our production and raise our levels of consumption, is an immense effort which can achieve its maximum results Only if the laws of economic interdependence are observed and if international cooperation is practised on a basis of equality  As in the case of any country in process of development, our productive capacity might be seriously hampered and even paralysed if we were unable at the same time to rely on a speedy and substantial demand from world markets in a position to absorb our exports and thereby to secure our purchasing power and means of exchange,I have referred only to my country experience as an example, although I am sure that other nations which, like it, are passing through the same stages of economic development, share its needs and concerns, and I feel that these needs are sufficient to justify our plea that the United Nations should devote its unswerving attention to this most important aspect of cooperation and solidarity among peoples We are prepared, as always, to offer the United Nations any contribution which we may be able to make on the basis of the technical experience and knowledge we have acquired concerning the various matters related to the process of the economic development of nations  We attach particular importance to the valuable efforts contributed by the Economic and Social Council, of which my country hopes shortly to become a member, and we trust that our application for admission will be favourably received in  We cherish this hope because we understand that active participation in the work of such an important United Nations organ must be of the greatest benefit, by reason of the high quality of the study and research which that organ carries out in the economic and social fields, in which my Government is especially interested and in which it has already achieved so much at the national level Furthermore, can say that our country attaches equal importance, as we have previously stated, to the social questions under consideration at this session] among these I would mention, together with questions which are just as important, the question of international respect for the right of peoples to selfdetermination and the recognition of political rights for women  We shall naturally collaborate with the utmost goodwill and determination in securing both those rights In view of the high honour conferred upon the Dominican Republic when it was chosen some years ago as a nonadministering member of the Trusteeship Council, we are anxious to contribute from the technical experience acquired by us in this field to all subjects to be examined by the General Assembly in connexion with the application of the International Trusteeship System, and we are prepared to give our unreserved support to any steps which may contribute effectively to the promotion of the political, economic, social and educational progress of the inhabitants of the Trust Territories and thus ensure that those peoples may proceed without hindrance along the path towards selfgovernment or independence The questions before the Sixth Committee are of equal concern to us  Amongst them those concerning the establishment of an international criminal jurisdiction and the definition of aggression are of particular importance  As regards the plan for an international criminal court, we think that it would be necessary to settle satisfactorily certain major difficulties which might arise in connexion with the prerogatives and fundamental rights of States, before taking a final decision on the practicability of such a grandiose project  As to the definition of aggression, we must stress its importance not only as one of the supreme requirements of collective security, but also as an essential preliminary to the effective establishment of an international criminal jurisdiction The Government of the Dominican Republic takes this opportunity solemnly to reaffirm its unconditional adherence to and its full acceptance of the purposes and principles upon which the United Nations Chatter is based  My Government is anxious to make this act of faith before the General Assembly as an expression of its hope that the insecurity and disagreement prevailing at this moment in the work of our Organization may speedily give place to a vigorous and close collaboration among the peoples and States exercising political dominion over the world, to the end that a firmly established feeling of good neighbourliness, that quality of which we are so proud in interAmerican relations, may prevail ever more forcefully and effectively within the United Nations Discarding the negative attitudes of scepticism and impatience, we are so optimistic as to pin our faith to devotion to the higher values of the spirit and the indestructible empire of law, justice and freedom  Thus inspired, we are taking part in these debates, as at all previous sessions, in the same spirit of collaboration, with the abiding purpose of assisting the great Powers to find honourable means of conciliation and understanding ; with the same faith in the power of our Organization to ensure amongst all nations the inevitable triumph of the rule of law; and with the same hope that we are now witnessing the dawn of international peace in which man, who is struggling towards perfection, may find an appropriate environment for the full realization of his high destiny and the final achievement of the universal aspiration of brotherhood and progress   My delegation wishes to offer the President the congratulations due to him on his election to preside over the work of this General Assembly, for we are encouraged by the hope that the work that awaits us on the proposed agenda will be carried out In the favourable atmosphere engendered by the goodwill of all of us who bear the grave responsibilities we assumed under the United Nations Charter  His election is a guarantee that this will be so, despite the magnitude of the task and the obstacles that will stand in the way of our efforts to find viable solutions to the problems on our agenda that will satisfy all the interests concerned and the aspirations that we all share  Under your skilful direction we must hope that all the difficulties, disagreements and misunderstandings that may arise during this session that is just starting will be helped by the moderating spirit and the harmonious goodwill that prevailed at the birth of our Organization at San Francisco  The United Nations gained maturity after being subjected to the most cruel tests, which, far from having weakened its power as the chief instrument for saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war, have enabled it to rise afresh each time with the necessary vitality to safeguard and to proclaim with authority the pronouncements in the preamble and the guiding principles enshrined in the Charter  At the last session of the General Assembly, the delegation of the Dominican Republic appeared for the first time as the genuine representatives of a democratic State ruled by a constitutional Government elected by universal suffrage, after the vicissitudes that the principles on which the Republic had been based in had suffered for many years  The Government which I have the honour to represent at this rostrum not only bases its desires for justice and progress on the will of the people to survive and to work out an effective democracy on the lines of that defined in the Charter of Santiago de Chile, but also to give unlimited respect to the legal order of the United Nations and to the rights inherent in man, which are the guarantee of the human species  At the end of a year of that profession of faith, my delegation is glad to affirm that today the Dominican Republic Is a State based on law and its democratic institutions are guaranteed by a Constitution that has satisfied the social, political and economic demands of the Dominican people, despite the economic and financial collapse from which the country was suffering when the constitutional period of Government started on July  as a result of a prolonged political crisis and the ravages of the civil war  The progress made by the Dominican Republic during the constitutional period of Government under the leadership of Mr  Joaquin Balaguerhas fully justified the confidence of the people, who voted overwhelmingly in favour of it  Their vote confirmed the determination of the people to live under the protection of a democratic régime that was able to establish the rule of justice, internal public confidence and international prestige, after the disruption brought about by the serious events that had disturbed the institutional life of the Republic for years, when the armed and civil rebellions, facilitated by the previous armed conflict, had not yet been put down and the majority of the population had an alarming quantity of destructive weapons at their disposal and veritable arsenals were concealed in various parts of the country  It must be recognized that while, on the one hand, the task to be carried out called for a bloodless campaign for this type of disarmament, on the other hand there was a need for spiritual disarmament to overcome the danger and obstacles in the way of restoring to all minds the good sense and wisdom that had perished under the impetus of a state of disorder, pitilessly directed, that had taken possession of the will and patriotic sentiments that have been the outstanding characteristics of a people enamoured of freedom and independence  At the present time the country has made great progress towards the reconciliation and pacification of the communities, profoundly divided by political rancour which a disrupted economy has made worse and worse, bringing the disorder to a state not unlike that of the disasters that shatter the normal life of peoples  I would not be sincere in making this statement if I did not acknowledge that the country is still faced with some difficulties, which must be recognized as the remnants of the process of general disruption and of a real state of war with all the evils that such situations generate  These difficulties naturally affect the Government plans for the total restoration of the national economy and of the results that are to be expected of the finances of a progressive State, where the juridical and administrative authorities are doing their utmost to overcome one of the most disturbed periods in the history of the country  In spite of these reservations, which I feel obliged to make, I must state here that the general Dominican situation already allows us to hope for the progressive recovery of all the factors that are essential for the restoration of the economic order and the rationalization of financial stability  While we are still convalescing from many of the merciless evils that endangered democratic principles in the national territory, I can affirm that the necessary safeguards for the investment of national and foreign capital have been strengthened and public and private initiative has been encouraged by appropriate modern means, for the mobilization of all the productive forces of the country in order to rescue the copious natural resources that can stimulate those investments and the boundless wealth of possibilities that the country offers from the stagnation that had overtaken them  Thus we hope to overcome, in a short space of time, the inertia that has been the actual cause of the delay in making progress in a medium that is so propitious for the achievement of the techniques recommended to the less developed countries  In order to give the development plans a more dynamic character, the public Administration has made a great effort to give undiscriminating assistance for the development of diversified agriculture; it has managed to inspire confidence in stock breeding activities, which could rise to much higher levels from which the producers could profit in foreign markets; it has improved the deficit situation of the sugar industry in the dependent zones of the State  In that last respect, the increase in the quota assigned to the Dominican Republic in the United States market, after negotiations which were welcomed in the competent official centres, offers new prospects, not only in regard to the economic yield Itself but also to the acquisition of the currency needed to give a more ambitious direction to the economic and financial system, whose scientific machinery is already operating, governed by the most advanced methods adapted to the modalities, possibilities and demands of the medium for which these instruments of economic progress in our time are designed  In the Government programmes, which cover all promising fields, electrification is also being considered as a means of ensuring the constant expansion of industry, better conditions of economic life through the reduction of unemployment to a minimum and better paid use of labour  These programmes, which are now in full operation, include a considerable number of public works of every kind and provide for immediate and direct action by the Government to carry out the largescale building activities that are needed to solve, as far as possible, the disturbing problem of housing  The development plans, whose scope I need not enlarge upon in this sketch of the Dominican situation, are also designed to provide greater guarantees and facilities for trade expansion and, in particular, to secure foreign markets for the national products and to stimulate an immediate and rapid increase in those productive activities  It is for this reason that the Dominican Republic supports the principles and resolutions concerning Latin American economic integration, which culminated in the Meeting of American Chiefs of State at Punta del Este and, more recently, the session held at Asuncion, Paraguay, at the ministerial level, which was an essential step for the adoption of the Latin American common market within the prescribed time  All these projects, some of which are already in operation, have been and will be possible in my delegation country because of the Government policy of arming all men with goodwill and initiative and freeing the minds of the people of the passions that have so deplorably divided the Dominican family  The Administration is indeed convinced that the destiny of the country depends on the pacification of consciences and the passage from revolution, in the way in which it was suffered by the people, to a true revolution of the people, consisting of progress and the uniting of all Dominicans to channel the immutable attributes of the Republic towards a new destiny of civilization and general wellbeing  Lastly, I must acknowledge that the technical assistance we have received from the United Nations, the economic and technical assistance of the Organization of American States and the economic impetus that the Alliance for Progress has been providing through that organization, in accordance with the principles adopted at the Punta del Este meeting which gave rise to the Alliance, have been of great help in the efforts undertaken by the Dominican Government and people to lift the country out of the unfavourable situation into which it had sunk  I thought it well, before speaking of the items on the agenda, to give a precise survey of the progress made by the Dominican Republic and I hope that in so doing I have confirmed the favourable predictions made by the Dominican delegation at the twentyfirst session of the General Assembly  It gives my delegation great pleasure to express its gratitude for the honour that has been conferred on it in being chosen as one of the VicePresidents of this Assembly  This is undoubtedly a recognition of the efforts that my Government is making to reaffirm the principles of effective democracy and to comply with the rules established by the Charter, as well as reflecting proportional representation of the various geographical regions  The Dominican Republic reaffirms the sacred and inalienable right of selfdetermination of peoples  This principle brought about the separation of our people from the metropolitan country and the appearance of the Republic in international life, influenced by the liberal ideas of the French revolution, the liberating ideals of Simon Bolivar and the declarations concerning determinant rights  Armed with these firm convictions, we shall always support the immutable right of peoples to become free and independent States, wherever they may be and providing the desire for independence is an expression of the will of the dependent communities, whatever may be the size of the territory or the density of the population  We believe that our status as a State constituted in exercise of the right of selfdetermination, to which all peoples are entitled, does not allow us to disregard this principle or to remain indifferent to any weakening of it by the governing Powers for reasons of selfinterest or policy  In  during the sixteenth session of the General Assembly, the Dominican delegation maintained that, if denuclearization was indivisible, then it should be recognized that Latin America, as a region, had the right to adopt an individual denuclearization agreement  Scarcely five years later, this view was shared by nearly all the Latin American countries  This proposal for the banning of nuclear weapons, which was designed in this part of the hemisphere for the countries which not only realize that it is impossible for them to produce weapons of this destructive nature but are reluctant to weaken their economy still further when there are such urgent demands for material, social, political and cultural development, produced the essentially wise result of bringing about a collective will opposed to the introduction of weapons of mass destruction in this part of the world, in conflict with the inequality of defence of the Powers involved in this matter  As a result of this state of mind, on February the Latin American countries signed in Mexico the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America [see A/, which had come about as a result of the various sessions which had preceded the drafting and signature of this instrument  The Dominican Government decision to become a party to this important Treaty does not in anyway interfere with any agreements on this serious problem which the nuclear Powers may make among themselves  In keeping with the position that we have adopted on the question of general and complete disarmament, my country will continue its efforts to bring about the favourable atmosphere which may lead to the adoption, through the United Nations, of an instrument giving effect to this noble aspiration  In accordance with our consistent devotion to the natural principle of the selfdetermination of peoples, my delegation is inclined prima facie to think that, at the right time and place, the people of Korea should express their wishes through an electoral consultation, in a direct vote held on the basis of universal suffrage and guaranteed by the United Nations  For this purpose it would be necessary to prepare a consultation based on the functions that have been entrusted to the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea  My Government doubts whether, in the state of affairs which large regions subject to the principles of the Charter and to other advances of positive international law are experiencing, a step of such great implications could be taken in the near future  The problem calls for clear and precise replies to many unknown factors in order that the final decision on the subject, and its implementation, may not meet with other complications that might make it more difficult to put an end to a situation in which not only the Powers concerned but all States Members of the United Nations are interested  Whatever decision is taken on this important item of the agenda will have to conform to the requirements of the legal and peaceful settlement of disputes  Whatever steps meets with general agreement, It will have to take into account all the previous happenings that led to the Korean situation, with the important participation of the Security Council in the circumstances with which we are all familiar  Whatever settlement is agreed upon, it will have to satisfy the need for effective and legitimate security measures calculated to maintain the status quo until such time as the final decisions are put into effect  With regard to the policy of the Government of the Republic of South Africa, we have to admit that whatever proceedings may be contemplated must be in keeping with the declaration in paragraph of Article of the Charter, which lays down the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations: To achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion  This Is clearly a provision that Member States are called upon to fulfil, although the subject of human rights has become a glaring reality as the cause of international tensions which are liable to unleash the scourge of war, a result which all States which are subject to the regime of the world Organization are in duty bound to avoid  This situation is one of great delicacy which requires to be handled with the greatest circumspection, in view of the fact that the principles of the Charter oblige Member States to refrain from intervening in the domestic affairs of other States, even if those Members of the United Nations are subjects of international law which are not contractually bound to the United Nations  On this matter my Government is of the opinion that, in view of the tensions to which we have referred, it would be wise not to prolong the sanctions which have been adopted beyond what is expedient and not to extend their field of application unduly  It is this thought that gives the Dominican Republic serious doubts with regard to Rhodesia and South West Africa  I must explain that my Government regards these general considerations only as a basis for deductions which may meet with the approval of the States which are trying to find more perfect solutions  The Dominican Republic intends to take part in the second session of UNCTAD, which is to be held at New Delhi from February to March  taking a realistic view of our problems and with the desire to obtain the cooperation of the developed countries in confronting the delaying influence, a social evil which is just as complex as the evils of ignorance, destitution and poverty suffered by peoples  It is to be hoped that we shall have the same hope at New Delhi that we had at Geneva in  Since that last session, there have been as many obstacles to the progress of the underdeveloped countries as there were before  When it is possible to appraise the practical results achieved, it will become clear that very little progress has been made towards the achievement of the objectives set forth in the Geneva Final Act, In this connexion special mention should be made of the deterioration in the terms of trade brought about in the foreign trade of the countries which are struggling to achieve more satisfactory levels  I do not think there is any need for me to repeat here that we must always recognize that the development of our countries depends essentially on their exports  This is a problem inherent in development not only as a vital necessity for the peoples but even more as an imperative requirement for survival  Thus the fall in the prices of many of our basic products to levels that are sometimes desperately low is a tragedy for us  Nevertheless, we feel that in this age of burning realities we must not foster illusions that might lead to acts of unforeseeable consequences  The item concerning the world social situation is also of special interest to us  It is only by a thorough knowledge of the facts and of their different characteristics in the different regions that we can arrive at effective ways of finding specific and workable solutions in a field of such magnitude and such complexity  There is no denying that wars have their origin in the spirit of men and it is therefore in the spirit of men that the defences of peace must be conceived  The majority of countries in the world are confronting a crisis which is not only political and economic but also, and very emphatically, a crisis of understanding  It is clear from history that misunderstanding among the countries of the world has been the cause of the suspicion and mistrust that have dragged nations into the disagreements and frictions that cause war  We therefore feel that the item should be discussed on the basis of all the particular points that are likely to generate social phenomena and to bring the peoples nearer to the road that leads to their wellbeing, which in the last resort is the road of peace  We urge once again that the problem of VietNam should be solved on the basis of agreements satisfying the opposing interests and we recognize that the precedent established by the peaceful and democratic elections in which the people of VietNam had an opportunity to express their wishes freely through their votes is a sign that a legitimate right properly exercised can still meet the challenge of armed force  These results provide a fresh element on which to form the decision that must be taken on the request of the peaceloving peoples  Lastly, we reiterate our confidence that the situation in the Middle East can be settled through negotiations which respect the procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes  The blood of Quijote flows in the veins of all us Latin Americans to a greater or lesser degree, and for that reason we are always ready to break lances in honour of the great lady called freedom, for it is only she who will produce the peace for which we long  We must be attached to peace and international brotherhood if we wish to survive  Only through the widest cooperation among peoples, the sole means at our disposal, can we find a strong shield against the disasters of individual ambitions  Our voice is the voice of the small nation that calls upon the great nations to reflect, so that they may fulfil their great destiny and their great duty  The voice of the weak, armed with law and justice, can be stronger than the voice of the strong, armed with their own political interest  We do not like to see the great nations using their power to trample on the small, nor do we like to see various nations aligned for the destruction of other nations or for destruction among themselves, A pragmatic conception of life teaches us that political inequality inevitably accompanies the juridical equality of States  These considerations bring to mind the unchanging Dominican thesis, faithfully and brilliantly expressed by Dr  Americo Lugo, our country great orator and internationalist, at the Fourth American International Conference, held at Buenos Aires in  for we have always pursued a great ideal, striving for it and ready to die for it if necessary  This great voice of a small nation at this big Conference was praised by Leopoldo Lugones, the eminent Argentine poet, who said: 'Whether or not it is the voice of the weak, it is the most honourable and the noblest that has been heard at this Conference  Dr  Americo Lugo, criticizing the lack of a great ideal in the programme, said: The established nations which are prosperous and rich are looking for markets; but those that are not prosperous but are weak and poor are seeking peace, stability and freedom before markets  I do not believe in wealth — he added — but in virtue, ideals are more necessary than bread  To think one thing and to profess another dishonours diplomacy  Sincerity is the chastity of nations  Carlos Mascari called Lugo the valiant defender of the American ideal  Let us hold fast to these ideas and follow this path  As far as we Dominicans are concerned, that is our national and international line of conduct  \\ufeffOn behalf of the Government of the Dominican Republic and of the delegation which I have the honour of leading, I wish to convey to Mr  Lusaka our most sincere congratulations on his election to preside over the work of the thirtyninth session of the General Assembly  This welldeserved distinction recognizes his role as a fighter for the cause of peace and the wellbeing of nations, his brilliant work as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia and his effective cooperation in the United Nations  His election augurs well for the balanced and fruitful conduct of this session  This wise choice is also an eloquent tribute to the country, Zambia, and to the entire African continent, which is characterized by its devotion to the quest for a fairer international social order My delegation also pays a tribute to the outgoing President, Mr  Jorge Illueca, for his efficient leadership of the deliberations of the General Assembly at the thirtyeighth session  His diplomatic skill won him the admiration of all and is a source of pride to the peoples of Latin America I should also like to express our gratitude to the SecretaryGeneral for his perseverance in translating into reality the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for his invaluable contributions to the cause of progress and international peace and security Allow me to extend a most cordial welcome to the new State of Brunei Darussalam, which recently won independence  Its efforts to realize the ideals of justice pursued by the United Nations will undoubtedly prove to be an asset to the Organization The international situation, which grows more alarming each passing day, should be a matter of collective concern to all peaceloving nations and should, of necessity, lead them to strengthen the United Nations  This firm belief inspires me to reiterate the idea I put forward in my statement at the thirtyeighth session that:At this difficult time in the history of mankind, international cooperation, which is an essential element for harmonious coexistence among nations, must be the force behind our actions if we are to overcome the present situation  In view of the growing interdependence that characterizes contemporary international relations, today problems affect all the members of the international community but have a greater impact on the least developed among them  We are therefore concerned at the tendency on the part of some industrialized States to abandon the necessary cooperation among States, which should be based on  a profound feeling of solidarity  We must create a real political will to embark upon genuine international cooperation, which should have as its aim the establishment of social justice among our peoples International life is dominated by the critical choice between war and peace  There is a close interdependence between two basic requirements for the growth and advancement of the developing countries: first, the creation of conditions of peace and security and, secondly, the launching of a new international economic order  The arms race militates at one and the same time against attaining both of these requirements The stalemate in the disarmament negotiations between the two superPowers has resulted in quantitative and qualitative arms escalation  The international tension created by that escalation is one of the principal obstacles to the attainment of those goals  Moreover the resources that should be devoted to development are being used instead to produce more sophisticated armaments In this important matter, I wish to state that we associate ourselves fully with the Joint Declaration on peace and world disarmament made on May by the Heads of State or Government of Argentina, Greece, India, Mexico, Sweden and the United Republic of Tanzania  We agree with those illustrious statesmen that:The power and ingenuity of the human race must be used, not to perfect weapons of annihilation, but to harness the resources of the earth so that all people may enjoy a life of security and dignity in an international system free of war and based on peace and justice For the Dominican Republic, negotiation and dialogue are the best instruments in the search for peace  There is no dispute for which a fair solution cannot be found through the means of peaceful settlement provided by international law and the Charter of the United Nations itself  As a corollary to this deepfelt conviction, our Government takes a consistent position of principle that of rejecting, in so far as international coexistence is concerned, any threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State Keeping the peace should be an indivisible commitment for all Members of the United Nations  We applaud and encourage the work being done by the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization with a view to preventing international conflicts and diminishing the risk that they pose  My delegation values that work very highly and announces here its constant willingness to contribute to the attainment of those basic objectives At the past two sessions of the General Assembly, I explained in detail that my country was desirous of and interested in cooperating in bringing about a negotiated settlement to the Central American conflict  The Government of the Dominican Republic has constantly echoed those responsible voices that offer assistance in restoring peace in those brother countries, free from outside impositions or interference, and in devoting their energies and resources to the requirements of development On his very first day in office, in August  the President of my country, Mr  Salvador Jorge Blanco, in the Santo Domingo declaration issued jointly with four other Latin American leaders, recommended dialogue and negotiations as means for resolving the crisis in Central America, along with other measures for bringing about political, social and economic recovery in the region The Dominican Republic has always expressed support for the steps taken by the Contadora Group, maintaining an unchanging and unequivocal position in this regard  The outstanding process of mediation undertaken by Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela has culminated in the Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation in Central America, which we hope will be signed as soon as possible  It is clear that, while the actions of the Contadora Group have received the encouragement and backing of the United Nations and the international community, this final stage of overriding importance requires the full, active and complementary support of the countries of the Latin American region particular and of the international community as a whole  We wish to record our gratitude and express our encouragement to the Central American countries which have already stated their willingness to sign this important document Similarly, we share the view that assistance from countries with ties to the Central American region would be highly desirable to ensure the effective implementation of the Contadora Act  We believe that the best way of achieving this important goal would be through a determined effort of solidarity by Latin America that would eliminate or at least reduce to a minimum a certain element of confrontation, directly or indirectly, in our hemisphere that could affect the situation in Central America It is the duty of Latin America as a whole to promote the detente and understanding that would effectively guarantee the establishment of peace in the region  The parties involved must therefore make reciprocal concessions which, in turn, provide mutual benefits, principally in the important areas of national security and economic and social development It has been an invariable tenet of the foreign policy of the Dominican Republic that any type of colonial domination, whatever form it might take, must be rejected  In line with this attitude, we note with concern that there are still areas of the world under colonial domination  These constitute sources of unrest and tension in the sphere of international relations and endanger international peace and security One persistent source of unrest is the disregard of the legitimate claim of the Argentine Republic to territorial sovereignty over the Malvinas  We regret the lack of progress at the meeting at Berne last July between representatives of the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom  We cordially urge the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to resume their negotiations, and we reiterate our support for the renewed mission of good offices undertaken by the SecretaryGeneral with a view to assisting the parties to those negotiations The insecurity and sufferings of peoples are not limited to one geographical area  I should like to refer to other events, topics and circumstances which affect international life and are of concern to the Government of the Dominican Republic First, I wish to express the Dominican Republic profound anxiety over the situation prevailing in southern Africa  A mere glance at this part of the world shows us that apartheid, racial discrimination and colonial domination continue blindly to resist the natural and legitimate forces of social change  The heroic struggle of the peoples of southern Africa for selfdetermination must receive the most decisive support of the international community I reaffirm the full solidarity of the Dominican people with the people of Namibia and our unreserved support for the struggle being waged by SWAPO, the legitimate representative of the Namibian people, for the liberation of their territory and the establishment of an independent State based on the principles of equality, freedom and justice Among the disturbed regions of the world, the Middle East has been a constant source of concern to the United Nations since the Organization inception  My country unswervingly maintains its position that the achievement of a just and lasting peace in the region requires prior acceptance of the view that the question of Palestine is the core of the Middle East situation We therefore urge, as we have on previous occasions, that the necessary conditions be fostered to enable the Palestinian people to exercise, without any kind of outside interference or coercion, its right to selfdetermination, including its right to national independence and political sovereignty and to establish a State on Palestinian territory We reiterate equally strongly our heartfelt conviction that any peace solution in the Middle East must take into consideration Security Council resolution (, which recognizes the right of Israel to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries No less worrying is the situation in Lebanon— a country with traditional ties to the Dominican Republic—which is cruelly torn by fratricidal battles  We believe that now more than ever the paths of dialogue and negotiation should be explored there and that the international community is morally obliged to extend its full cooperation to the reconstruction process in Lebanon However, unanimous recognition of the need for the restoration of the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon and the withdrawal from its territory of all unauthorized foreign forces is an essential prerequisite for the settlement of the conflict The war between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq is taking its toll in death and destruction on both sides and is adversely affecting prospects of regional and global peace and security  We believe that the international organizations should be prepared to help and encourage the peacemaking process between the parties We reaffirm our belief that the desired reunification of the Korean people should be achieved through a negotiated settlement between the two parties, without outside interference or pressure One of the sustaining pillars of Dominican foreign policy is nonintervention in the internal affairs of other States  This has been a historical constant, evident throughout the life of our Republic  However, we consider that nonintervention is closely linked to another cardinal principle of international life: the selfdetermination of peoples  The Dominican Republic has invariably shown firm support for the right of peoples freely to decide the form of government they deem most suited to their national interests Our deep attachment to these principles impels us to express before this Assembly of the international community our profound concern at the situation prevailing in several parts of the world where foreign interference is damaging the sacred attributes of national sovereignty and independence  In this connection, we affirm our absolute rejection of the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Lebanon, Central America, Africa and anywhere else that this situation exists The Government of the Dominican Republic views with deep concern the upsurge of acts of terrorism in international life  It has condemned these and will always condemn them wherever they occur  We believe the recourse to terror, in any form and for any motive, is unacceptable to the international community and offends its conscience On the subject of scourges, I should like to refer to the Quito Declaration against Traffic in Narcotic Drugs, signed by the Presidents of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, by the representative of the President of Peru, by the Presidentelect of Panama, by a member of the Governing Junta of National Reconstruction of Nicaragua and by the VicePresident of Panama at Quito on August  We associate ourselves fully with the approach adopted in that Declaration—that is, to consider traffic in narcotics as a crime against humanity, with all the legal consequences applicable in such cases  We also support the proposal for the establishment of an international or regional fund to furnish aid to developing countries affected by traffic in narcotics, in order to combat and overcome the causes responsible for such situations and to provide the competent national institutions with suitable instruments to deal with such activities The international community is still being battered by the worst world economic crisis of recent decades  Despite some signs of recovery observed in certain industrialized economies, the international recession persists and the thirdworld countries— particularly those in Latin America—are still beset by economic stagnation and subjected to painful processes of adjustment which in the main are ineffective because of the lack of equity and symmetry in the distribution of the costs of international economic restructuring From the Second United Nations Development Decade, the , which held promise of a transfer of real resources to the developing areas, we have moved into a period dominated by the group and sectoral interests of some industrialized countries which, not fully realizing that we live in an interdependent world, have caused a reversal of financial assistance flows, leading to restrictions on market access and the pursuit of economic policies that have upset the international economic order Consequently, the sustained economic growth of a few years ago has come to a halt  Our peoples' purchasing power in strong currencies has dwindled  World trade is at a standstill  A dramatic shortage of international liquidity is threatening the stability of the financial and monetary system The thirdworld countries, which set their sights on industrialization during the  in the hope of absorbing growing unemployment, find that important industrial sectors cannot grow satisfactorily because the developed countries' economies, deprived of comparative advantages, are imposing quotas and restrictions on our principal exports One example is sugar, the underpinning and the mainstay of economies such as that of my country  Sugar is subjected to subsidies and protectionist measures which some developed countries extend to their producers and which are one of the main reasons for the decline in the world price of this commodity  In addition, the United States has just reduced by per cent the sugar quotas assigned to our countries  This measure is contrary to the philosophy underlying the promising initiative for the Caribbean basin sponsored by that country These protectionist measures show the extent to which the world economy may be destabilized if this type of behaviour continues to spread  If the countries that are most competitive in selling certain goods cannot find outlets for their production or do not obtain suitable prices for their commodities, where will they obtain the international liquidity to purchase goods from abroad or to finance the servicing of their eternal debt Clearly, the answer cannot be that this liquidity should be achieved at the expense of the standard of living of our peoples, because that solution would be economically unfair and politically and socially destabilizing and would have implications that could even endanger the international financial and monetary system itself During the  and , the relationship existing between trade and development was reflected principally in the fact that the surpluses generated by trade were recycled in the form of investments and loans  By contrast, the present trend is to concentrate capital inputs on the basis of incentives to encourage high interest rates and other measures involving substantial restrictions on international trade High interest rates are aggravating the external debt problem, by increasing financial costs  Thus, Latin America will have to pay out over $billion more than it would have had to pay out if the United States base rate had not risen by three points since the beginning of this year  In turn, the existence of such high interest rates encourages the outflow of capital to the financial centres, thus further reducing the capacity to pay and the international liquidity of our economies  That is one reason why Latin America, deeply in debt, has paradoxically become a net exporter of capital The figures supporting this statement are chilling  In net terms, Latin America is transferring to the industrialized countries over per cent of its gross domestic product  In over $billion, representing half of the region net savings, were transferred as interest and profits alone  Debt servicing—interest alone—absorbs per cent of Latin American exports  In the past four years, the region output declined by percent, and unemployment is still on the rise The severe deflation into which the developing countries' economies have been led, in order to create conditions in which debtservicing payments can be made, has undoubtedly reduced the threat looming over the financial order of the developed countries  But this has been achieved through severe, indeed traumatic, curtailments of imports and of consumption, through a decrease in the already precarious standard of living of our peoples and, in many cases, through disruption of social peace owing to the sacrifices required of peoples with fewer resources available to them My country, which has suffered at first hand the rigours of this crisis and the consequences of economic adjustments, cannot remain indifferent to this distressing social picture, which is working against the United Nations ideal of creating the necessary conditions of stability and wellbeing for peaceful and friendly relations among nations Faced with the serious phenomenon of external indebtedness, which as has been seen, has significant adverse effects on them, the Latin American countries have—it must be recognized—already set in train a dynamic process of solidarity, which is increasingly becoming an example for the third world and which is backed by firm political will The Quito Declaration and Plan of Action preceded by the Santo Domingo undertaking, and more recently the Cartagena Consensus and the Mar del Plata Communique are eloquent expressions of this solidarity and of this common will, whose main objective is to find a solution to the serious problems identified during the dialogue and to achieve understanding between all the parties concerned—in other words, between creditors and debtors This was clearly stated by the President of the Dominican Republic, Mr  Salvador Jorge Blanco, in a speech made at the University of South Carolina, before the President of the United States, Mr  Ronald Reagan, and other leaders of the Caribbean Community  He said:At Cartagena, we acknowledged the need to restructure our economies, to make the adjustments which will enable us to exercise selfdiscipline, but we also proclaimed the necessary joint responsibility for the solution of the crisis borne by the Governments of the creditor countries, the international banks and the international financial organizations The countries which joined in the Cartagena Consensus reaffirmed at Mar del Plata the need for direct political dialogue between creditors and debtors which would recognize the joint responsibility of all in the search for solutions to the crisis and lead to the achievement of a fairer economic order As the provisional secretariat of the consultation and followup machinery established under the Cartagena Consensus, the Dominican Republic will do everything in its power to help bring about the proposed political dialogue which, as stated at Mar del Plata, should preferably be held during the first half of  This political dialogue would also serve as an opportunity to review the role played by important international agencies such as the IMF and the World Bank in the international economic order As we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the solemn proclamation by the General Assembly of the new international economic order, we note with regret that the attitude of some industrialized countries is hindering the start of the global negotiations, the result being that the NorthSouth dialogue on international economic cooperation is being kept in a state of virtual paralysis There is still no progress in the negotiations, despite the notable flexibility of the nonaligned countries and the Group of  as evidenced at their most recent meetings, and despite the fact that the developed countries acknowledged at their economic summit meetings, such as those held at Williamsburg in and in London last June, the global nature of the international crisis and the interdependence which must necessarily exist between North and South Nevertheless, as shown by the report of the Committee on the Review and Appraisal of the Implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade, the industrialized countries are having difficulty in taking measures consonant with the agreed principles The proposals submitted at the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, held at Belgrade from June to July  proposals that were the fruit of concerted action involving representatives of approximately nations from three continents, were rejected—yet another example of the meagre responses of the industrialized countries, whose last two summit conferences, instead of giving rise to expectations and fostering hopes, caused painful frustrations The recently concluded Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, held at Vienna from to August, again provided a forum for a demonstration of the inflexibility of the most powerful nations in the face of the urgent need to promote a more stable economic order, showing that the voice of the third world at the end of the century is heard almost as a monologue of over voices rather than as part of a dialogue This obliges us to ponder the need for an effective expansion of SouthSouth cooperation in all spheres, since this would create better prospects for the strengthening of our economies, without any intention of diverting trade into exclusively horizontal patterns, because we fully recognize the high degree of interdependence prevailing m NorthSouth relations  This would not prevent our countries, which have very marked common interests, from strengthening their mutual trade, deliberately and with a very clear political will, in pursuit of the goal of remedying even partially the unequal treatment to which we are subjected We trust that the critical international economic situation will be a factor accelerating the informal consultations being held at the United Nations on the subject of global negotiations  At the end of this session of the General Assembly, we hope to have significant agreement in the area of global negotiations, the continued postponement of which is a source of discouragement to the developing countries Before concluding, I should like to say that my country, which is host to the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women, is extremely pleased to note the very efficient and capable work of the Institute in the performance of its vital tasks  We hope that the international community will continue to extend its support to this dynamic Institute  This new autonomous United Nations body is devoting its efforts to training and to the dissemination of information on the link existing between the development process and the situation of each individual in particular In this context, we must state that the modern world seems to have understood that when international relations are subordinated to the interests of the rich countries, the problems and aspirations of the vast majority of the developing countries—all seeking diversified and democratic solutions to the world crisis—are ignored International conflicts assume a much more complex character with unforeseeable consequences when due consideration is not given to the particular identity of our peoples and to the very special needs which they have at the various stages of their evolution and growth The approach of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations will provide a very propitious occasion for a review of our international system and of its efficiency  We attach vital importance to the level of understanding and knowledge possessed by the peoples of the world on the subject of the United Nations, so that mankind can identify with the principles, spirit and ideals of its Charter Forty, for the United Nations, is an age of maturity and experience, of vigour and of youth  To reflect on the commitments assumed by this universal Organization for the solution of conflicts, for disarmament, for human rights, for justice and for cooperation, is to realize that we all belong to one and the same community, which must seek peace and development through solidarity In reiterating on this occasion the firm support of the Government of the Dominican Republic for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, we urge the Members of the international community to strengthen the Organization, so that it may really serve as a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends  Mr  BALAGUER said that it was the first time that the General Assembly of the United Nations had met on the soil of France, the mother of liberty and the cradle of human rights  If the atmosphere of the world were at present less charged with anxiety and if the shadow of a fresh catastrophe did not darken the future of humanity, it would have been said that that change of headquarters, apart from whatever other motives involved, fulfilled a purpose of incalculable moral value  The three regular sessions of the Assembly of the United Nations had been held in the three countries of the world which most strongly represented the principles of political freedom and of respect for individual rights  The United Nations Organization, born in San Francisco, had been initiated in London; it had drawn its first breath in England, as though it had been desired that the representatives of all the nations should strengthen their faith in the renewal of liberty by the splendid sight of a famous people which had just arisen from the ruins of war, as a symbol of the indestructibility of the human spirit and as a symbol of justice and right — values which would never die, however persecuted The General Assembly had then moved to the United States of America, the most powerful democracy on earth and the home of the people which had decided the issue of the tremendous conflict by throwing into the balance the most formidable fighting machine that the world had ever seen The capital of France, the country which, with the Encyclopedists, had seen the birth of the loftiest ideals of modern political thought, now welcomed the United Nations  France, a great country, which was the pride of Latin culture, would by its history give the moral impulse required to overcome the feelings of distrust and pessimism which were beginning to undermine the foundations of the United Nations as in its last days they had those of the League of Nations The Dominican Republic, heir, like all the Latin American countries, to a French culture which almost from the beginning of nationhood was identical with that of Spain, had come to the Assembly in the hope that the atmosphere there would inspire the representatives of the great Powers, in whose hands was the fate of all humanity, to come to a friendly agreement which would remove once and for all the danger of a new world war, which, if it happened, would be the third ordeal which civilization would have had to undergo in the short course of one generation The contribution that a small country like the Dominican Republic and many others which were taking part in the Assembly on the same basis, protected by the inalienable principle of equal sovereignty, could make for the cause of world peace and recovery, was undoubtedly small  But within those limitations, which were necessarily imposed by its area and by the opportunities open to it, his country was proud of the faithful way in which it had carried out the terms of the San Francisco Charter and of the sacrifices it had made to join, to the extent permitted by its resources, in the gigantic task of world moral and economic reconstruction  The foundation of the United Nations Charter, as also that of the Covenant of the League of Nations, was respect for the rule of law, the essential condition of the peaceful coexistence of States within the supreme order of international relations  In the SecretaryGeneral’s annual Report, the Dominican Republic had been mentioned among those Members of the United Nations which had accepted without reservation the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice  The Dominican Republic had thereby shown its firm intention to have recourse at all times to the processes of law for the settlement of its disputes with other countries In the SecretaryGeneral’s report, the Dominican Republic had also been mentioned among those countries which had offered their protection and help to the children of the war devastated nations of Europe  Ever since the United Nations, by the creation of the International Children’s Emergency Fund, had begun its efforts on behalf of war orphans, his country had considered that the American nations, for the very reason that they were furthest from the wardarkened scene and had best escaped the terrible moral consequences of the war, were among those which should take a leading part in that magnificent humanitarian crusade  His country would accordingly, through the initiative of its President, contribute dollars to the Children’s Emergency Fund, and it had, at a co of nearly dollars, constructed a building which was even now ready for the reception and lodging of European children In all the other fields of activity of the United Nations, his Government had associated itself strongly with the unprecedented task to which the United Nations was pledged: the task of restoring to the world its lost confidence and stability  Apart from its work in the Interim Committee, where it had upheld several important recommendations such as those relating to mediation and peaceful means of settling disputes, his country had, during the year covered in the SecretaryGeneral’s last report, given the maximum amount of cooperation to the United Nations, not only in the economic but also in the moral and legal fields Turning to his country’s position in relation to the items of the agenda which would attract the greatest attention, Mr  Balaguer said that his country belonged to the American continent, a part of the world where there had been set up standards for the coexistence of nations which in many cases, if only by reason of the respect with which they were viewed, had superseded the traditional standards of law Two of the most important items of the agenda for his country were the problems of Greece and of Spain  Both those problems were essentially one from the legal point of view, for both were closely connected with the principle of the noninfringement of sovereignty and of the noninterference of a State in the domestic affairs of another State  When those problems came under discussion, the Dominican Republic would not fall into the contradiction characterizing the attitude of those countries which were strong protagonists of the principle of nonintervention when their own interests were involved or the interests of supporting ideological regimes but which were opposed to the same fundamental principle — the essential basis of relationships between States — when the Governments of countries of a different ideology were involved  The great Powers, which as such held the fate of the weak States in their hands and by their power had an influence upon the destiny of the world, could allow themselves such contradictions and at times confuse right with political expediency; but the smaller Powers, whose only protection was the principle, so often ignored in the history of international relationships, of the legal equality of sovereign States, could not with impunity turn their backs upon legal and moral standards which guaranteed their selfdetermination and represented for them the great armies and the guns of the great Powers  The fate of the small nations, which were in the great majority in the Assembly, would assuredly be very precarious if they took part in the discussions guided only by political interest and ideological passion  If they did, there would happen to them what had happened to Diomedes, who died, devoured by the very horses he had taught to eat human flesh  Men and governments were ephemeral, and the only enduring realities in the life of peoples were moral principles and the rule of law; unchanging conceptions that every country should preserve, surrounded, like the vestal virgins of old, by a kind of holy inviolability  If, by dislike for a political system or by doctrinal scruples, the small nations were to abandon any of the rigid principles of morality or right, they would merely betray the vital interests of their peoples and, blinded by the mirage of the nonessential, sell the birthright of future generations The Dominican Republic would conform to the same standards in discussing items of the agenda involving legal questions concerned with the domestic jurisdiction of States  In the discussion of problems such as that raised by Chile in relation to the USSR and that concerning the treatment of Indians in the Union of South Africa, his delegation would favour solutions ensuring respect for the traditional principles of public law which at the same time did not intrude upon the private domain of national sovereignty If it were possible to find a more liberal interpretation of certain Articles of the Charter, such as those relating to the right of veto which had been set up for the benefit of the great Powers, the Dominican Republic would, without hesitation, join the group of weak countries which desired the reduction to a minimum of the irritating privilege of the veto which violated for political purposes the principle, that , could not be surrendered, of the equality of States Mr  Balaguer affirmed, in conclusion, his faith in the work of the United Nations  That Organization was the only ark afloat amid universal shipwreck, the only legacy of human solidarity left to a sceptical and ruined world that had survived the horrors of war, and it would, as the SecretaryGeneral had so well said in his report, undoubtedly serve to bring the great Powers together and lead them to continue the conversations begun at San Francisco  But it also served, and that was of great importance, to keep alive the vacillating faith of the small nations in justice and right  The representatives of all the free peoples of the world, when they returned every year after a session of the Assembly, carried back to their own countries fewer hopes than they had had when they set out  But, despite their discouragement, when they summed up the work accomplished yearly on behalf of peace and realized that nothing positive had been done, they nevertheless preserved intact their faith in international justice, because for weeks on end they had been present at discussions in which the powerful nations had bowed on many occasions, in obedience to the provisions of the Charter, before the will of countries which lacked the power to make themselves heard on the field of battle, and because they knew that the very existence of the United Nations was in itself a guarantee of order and a call to reason in the midst of universal anxiety and anarchy  In the list of items proposed for the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly, one on which the Collective Measures Committee has made a very thorough report is particularly outstanding: “ Methods which might be used to maintain and strengthen international peace and security in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter ” The inclusion of this item holds out ground for hope, because all, or almost all, the political items in the agenda might yield results, could we but attain unanimity of opinion and resolve upon the adoption of such methods  Questions like the international control of atomic energy or the reduction and limitation of armaments could be solved provided we first reach general agreement on the manner in which peace is to be maintained and strengthened  We should also be on the way to finding practical and useful solutions for problems like those connected with the threats to the political independence and territorial integrity of certain Members of this world Organization  If we attain agreement on methods, we shall have gone halfway towards putting them into effect I therefore attach the utmost importance to the item arising out of the report of the Collective Measures Committee, for, if we were to succeed in taking a unanimous decision on it we should be able, sooner or later, to solve all the other political problems before us Nevertheless, the prospect before us is not encouraging  From the very first meeting of this session the sharp division of opinion on political problems has made itself felt  At earlier sessions, as we set to work, we were hopeful of reaching practical results in the political sphere and it was only as the days went by that the deep divergence of views became apparent, postponing the adoption of a concerted plan for peace and security  Our initial feeling of optimism was replaced by discouragement and scepticism I trust that on this occasion the reverse will be the case; I trust that the initial disappointment will very soon be replaced by renewed hope and faith  Or are we to believe the prophets who say that a new war is imminent  I cannot and will not believe that there is any nation which would dare to take upon itself the responsibility for unleashing a new world struggle which would shatter the achievements of civilization and our dearest and most fervent hopes of achieving a better future for mankind Is it possible that once again, wherever we turn our eyes, we shall see suffering, terror and desolation  Is it possible that once again death and destruction will rain from the skies, that tanks will ravage the fields made fertile by the farmer’s patient toil, that whole cities will disappear in a day as though by an evil spell, and that with them thousands of noncombatants will perish sacrificed to homicidal mania, old men awaiting a peaceful death in prayer or meditation, innocent children just awakening with a smile to the delights of life  Is it possible that we should return to barbarism and that the spiritual forces which constitute the dignity of the human mind should be unavailing to prevent it, as though, stripping ourselves of the attributes of civilization, which has nurtured and fostered the noble collective ideals of mankind, we were to return to grope our way blindly through the dark forests of instinct No! We abjure the appalling nightmare  War should now be a moral impossibility and all men must unite in their resolve to condemn it as such  And the best means of securing that end and avoiding war is the study and adoption of effective methods for the maintenance of international peace and security Clearly, if the adoption of such methods is to be wholly efficacious, it is vital that we should achieve that effective universality to which the United Nations aspires; another item on our agenda, that relating to the admission of new members, tends towards that end If all peaceloving nations which observe the principles of the Charter are to be admitted to the United Nations, it is unreasonable that, in the absence of any evidence that they have departed from those principles, the door of the United Nations should be shut against them by the arbitrary mechanism which is known as the “rule of unanimity” but which should rather be termed the “ privilege of the veto ”  I do not propose at this point to discuss, the privileges enjoyed by the permanent members of the Security Council because of their greater responsibility for the destiny of mankind, but I consider it excessive, in the matter of the admission of new members, that they should  have the power, by the mere casting of a single negative vote, to prevent the entry of other States into the United Nations Such a course might result in inconsistent and illogical decisions  Take, for instance, the case of Libya; suppose that, after the General Assembly has decided to set up an independent State there, when the time comes to put that decision into effect and, as a natural consequence of its fulfillment, to admit Libya to the United Nations, the new nation, created by the will of the Assembly, were prevented from taking its place among us for lack of a necessary vote in the Security Council  That situation has already arisen in the case of the Republic of Korea which was established by the United Nations and which has been the scene of the outbreak of the most serious conflict with which the United Nations has so far been faced  The case of Korea is such; that we can safely say that it is putting to the test the integrity and resolution which our Organization must display if it is to survive Insecurity and disagreement hang like threatening shadows over the work to which we have set our hands  Even so, the United Nations presses on with its task of bettering the political structure of the world and ensuring the wellbeing of all nations In the economic field, an indication of the paramount importance of our work, is given by the most comprehensive and important of the items to be considered by the Second Committee: the economic development of underdeveloped countries, under three heads, financing, land reform and technical assistance Similarly, in the social field, efforts are being continued to improve the position of refugees and stateless persons and to give the latter a status, while progress has also been made with the draft international covenant on human rights The work carried on, with increasing efficiency, by the Trusteeship Council has produced a number of important items for discussion by the Fourth Committee, including the rural economic development of the Trust Territories, the abolition of corporal punishment and the development of administrative unions affecting Trust Territories; to these items we must add the consideration of information from NonSelfGoverning Territories  Because of their substance, two items which involve points of fundamental legal importance are also to be dealt with by the Fourth Committee: the question of SouthWest Africa and the question of the full participation of Italy in the work of the Trusteeship Council,The Fifth Committee will as usual have to consider the administrative and financial work of the Organization; and, lastly, the Sixth Committee has to consider various problems of special importance in the development of law, beginning with the report of the International Law Commission  In some cases, because the subjects under consideration are new, it is important that States Members Should have more time to study them, which is the reason why the General Committee has recommended that the discussion of the draft code of offences against peace and security of mankind should be postponed until the seventh session  In other eases, for example, the draft declaration on rights and duties of States, objections have already been raised regarding the inclusion of certain principles which, being new, cannot be regarded as being fully incorporated in positive law and which, in the view of certain States Members, are a counsel of perfection in the development of law, although they do not believe that they have yet reached the point when they should be accepted as rules of law  The Latin American nations have already embodied many of these principles in positive form within the framework of the Organization of American States and will not, therefore, have any objection to them, but they may seek means of finding common ground with those Members which regard them only as a counsel of perfection  I feel sure, in short, that acceptable solutions can be found to avoid delay in the approval and adoption of the draft,Thug, the United Nations is continuing without pause the constructive work on which it has embarked  If our efforts could achieve as much in the political as in the technical field, the success of the United Nations would be decisive and complete  There is, however, no cause to be fainthearted  We must cherish the hope that, though the road be rough and difficult, we shall, for the good of humanity, succeed in ensuring that the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter finally prevail throughout the world (Translated from French) I do not wish to conclude without paying tribute to our host, immortal France  I shall therefore try, albeit haltingly, to express in the grand tongue of Renan and Chateaubriand my hope that the glorious spirit of France may be a source of inspiration to us in the accomplishment of our work  France, above all countries, has, throughout its history, professed and maintained with ardent faith the cult of beauty, the mind and liberty  \\ufeffThe international community iscurrently going through a period of reflection and selfdefinition  The great transformations that humanityexperienced during the course of the previous decade,as well as current challenges, demand greaterresponsibility on the part of our nations in playing anactive role in the search for urgent solutions to theproblems that are affecting us  This new session of theGeneral Assembly presents us with an excellentopportunity to achieve that goal Today, the Dominican Republic reaffirms itscommitment to peace, the defence of human rights,security, sustainable development and thestrengthening of democracy — pillars of indisputableimportance in safeguarding international peace andstability The issue of the reform of the United Nations hasbeen on our agenda for a long time  Events of recentyears make it clear that this task must be undertaken asa matter of priority  The reform the Security Council isparticularly urgent  Ever since the approval ofresolution of December  we have beenengaged in an ongoing debate on the various reformproposals  Now, however, it is time to act to restructurethe Council so as to make it more representative andequitable, as well as more transparent in its decisionmaking, thereby strengthening its legitimacy as theguarantor of international peace and security Terrorism has emerged as an ongoing threat tohumanity  Uncertainty and pain have characterized thebeginning of the twentyfirst century  Our nations havethe challenge of fighting together, at a global level,against the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction and in favour of equitable development andfree societies  Security problems call for decisiveaction against international terrorism, organized crimeand the illegal trade in arms and drugs The Millennium Summit established as one of itsmain goals the reduction of poverty by per cent by Notwithstanding some progress in theachievement of those goals, poverty remains a terriblescourge  The Dominican Government, which considersthat issue to be one of great importance, has created aSocial Cabinet to act as a coordinating mechanism forall governmental institutions for social welfare, and ishelping to ensure that both national and internationalresources are distributed equitably and allocated toregions that require social investment All countries must join efforts, acceptingresponsibilities, both shared and separate, to guaranteethat growth and poverty do not go together and that, inmeeting the needs of the present generation, we do notcause the destruction of future generations’ capacity tomeet their own needs The positive outcome of the Fourth MinisterialConference of the World Trade Organization, held inDoha, Qatar, in November  and of theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment held in Monterrey, Mexico, in March was a key element for achieving millenniumdevelopment goals  The Doha Development Agendaand the Monterrey Consensus provided a framework tofacilitate market access, improve multilateralregulations for channelling globalization and increasefinancial aid for development However, we must mention what happened at theFifth Ministerial Conference of the World TradeOrganization (WTO) recently held in Cancún, Mexico Although agreement was not reached because offundamental differences in the positions regardingessential world trade issues, we are convinced that thiswill not affect the multilateral system of negotiations On the contrary, some member states maintain that thisimpasse may even be necessary to shape moreequitable international agreements at the heart of theWTO  What is an important issue is not to lose thedevelopment perspective within the work programmeof the WTO, as set in the Doha Development Agenda,because that agenda includes the aspirations of millionsof people around the world, whose hope for progresslies in the opportunities of the global economy The position of the Dominican Government withregard to the Middle East conflict is based primarily onunconditional adherence to the norms and principles ofinternational law, particularly those related to thepeaceful solution of disputes; condemning the use offorce and terrorism in all its forms; complying in goodfaith with international treaties; and on strictobservance of resolutions of the United Nations and itsdeliberative bodies Devoted to these principles, the DominicanRepublic has, in response to the humanitarian appealsof the Security Council, participated in the efforts torebuild Iraq, in order to contribute to the developmentof a secure and stable environment in which thesovereignty of the Iraqi people may be restored Similarly, our country supports the peace processoutlined in the road map submitted by the United Statesof America and endorsed by the Russian Federation,the United Nations and the European Union  Weunderstand that a cessation of violence cannot bepostponed, along with the historic pledges of all partiesto make sacrifices to promote a lasting solution to theconflict and peaceful coexistence Drawing up sustainable development policiescalls for dealing with problems before they emerge This implies making headway in achieving themillennium development goals, particularly on crucialissues such as energy and protection of theenvironment  In this respect, our nation reiterates itsrejection of the international maritime transport ofradioactive and toxic waste, a position which has beenexpressed in other international forums  This issue islinked to international security The importance of guaranteeing women equalrights and equity, and promoting their increasedpolitical participation, has been a continuous concernof the heads of State in various international forums The International Research and Training Institute forthe Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), the onlyinstitution within the United Nations system dedicatedexclusively to that end, has its headquarters in SantoDomingo, capital of the Dominican Republic  TheDominican Government calls upon Member States tocontinue supporting the work of INSTRAW in theDominican Republic by providing contributions, to theextent that they can Our country commends the culture of peace, andis making efforts to ensure that at the primary levelchildren are taught about promoting mutualunderstanding and learn about civics and human rights Similarly, we believe that a solid and permanentdemocracy is an achievable goal  The challenges hereare clear: growing democracy, more respect for civicrights, freedom of the press; freedom of expression ofpolitical parties and public opinion; dignity andtransparency of all leaders and the moral legitimacy ofall Deeply concerned about the spread of HIV/AIDSin our nation, the Government has made great efforts tocomply with the commitments entered into in theDeclaration on fighting this terrible disease  We call forincreased international cooperation and efforts toguarantee the availability of drugs at affordable prices,based on the Doha Declaration on intellectual propertyand the right to health The Dominican Republic salutes with optimismthe role played by the United Nations and theOrganization of American States (OAS) in efforts todevelop humanitarian aid programmes for the Haitianpeople  It is imperative to stress here the need forgreater support from the international community forour neighbouring republic of Haiti and its neglectedpopulation Although we are aware that this issue has beenexcluded from the agenda of the current session , wewish to state our support for the aspirations of theRepublic of China, Taiwan, to rejoin this Organization,of which it was a Member for many years  Our positionis in line with the universal principles contained in theCharter, the basis of the rules of international law andthe historical tradition of friendly relations withTaiwan On behalf of the Dominican Government, Sir,may I congratulate you on your election as President,confident that your conduct of this session will besuccessful, beneficial for the international communityand a source of pride to your country, Saint Lucia, andthus to our Caribbean community I also wish to express the DominicanGovernment’s rejection of the barbaric act perpetratedagainst the United Nations Mission in Baghdad on August, and to reiterate to the families of Mr  SergioVieira de Mello and of the other deceased colleaguesour most heartfelt condolences We are all aware of the great challengesconfronting humanity  Our future depends on theactions we take now  We have the opportunity to meetthe expectations of the nations of the world  Let us takeup this challenge with all due responsibility  Allow me first to express the congratulations of our delegation on the keen perception with which the General Assembly has chosen Mr  Amerasinghe to preside over this session containing in its agenda issues for study and decision of great importance to States Members of die United Nations  We are certain that his privileged experience and his wisdom will facilitate the achievement of our common purpose in the search for just solutions as well as in the results of our deliberations  Let us then hope that, guided by the values he represents, we will be able to say at the end of our work that at this thirtyfirst session of the General Assembly considerable progress has been made and that we have been able to clear up the unknown factors that have held back progress toward a new policy of understanding and effective decisionmaking in the difficult task of fulfilling the mandate imposed by the expectations of our times under the Charter of our world Organization I wish to convey the most heartfelt congratulations to Mr  Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the brilliant manner, the goodwill and competence with which he presided over the thirtieth session of the General Assembly also wish to express the deep appreciation of my Government for the effective and vigorous work of Mr  Kurt Waldheim, the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, who has so faithfully served the principles of the Organization  The delegation of the Dominican Republic is pleased to offer its congratulations also to the Republic of Seychelles for having been admitted as a Member of the United Nations  These congratulations on behalf of my Government and of the people of the Dominican Republic are addressed to the Government of the people of the young Republic of Seychelles as well as to its delegation, with which we have the honor to participate in this General Assembly We are here at the thirtyfirst session of the General Assembly of this important body at a time when the economy of developing countries such as ours are facing difficult situations which must find a prompt and happy situation  At the same time, however, we are strengthened by the ideals which inspired the founder of the Republic, Juan Pablo Duarte, known among  us as the Christ of Freedomwhom all Dominicans honor this year in just tribute on the centenary of his death whose selfless life was passionately and completely devoted to the emergence of a new nation in the American continent under the protection of God, the fatherland and liberty While we realize that all items to be discussed at this session are of great importance, we cannot forget the needs we are faced with, and speaking on behalf of my country I wish to mention in particular that we shall raise the problem of the sugar market with its falling prices as well as other points which have been causing a deterioration in the peaceful coexistence of nations and our very existence as States  That is why we are going to limit our considerations to those matters The idea of a collective security system has always been present in the United Nations  On the other hand it is not too bold to think that it has never been more justified to see to it that its Member States favor having a practical instrument, an instrument which may prove effective in preserving peace and proscribing the scourge of war so as to imbue the Charter with more vigor in that field We know very well that there are innumerable obstacles to the emergence of such a mechanism because of the differences and the controversies which produce stagnation and which create a climate adverse to reconciling conflicting interestsinterests which instead of diminishing have multiplied in the last years The problem, as complex as it may be, must be viewed in the light of other criteria  Among them that of the international economy is essential Actually there are also reasons to consider it necessary to recognize that collective security is not possible without economic security  Both causes produce the same effects: economic insecurity drives peoples to collective insecurity  Thus, if the former could be attained through a process similar to an effective moratorium on the tensions produced by harsh disputes and conflicts it would be possible for peace not to be precarious, which it has been for many years, and to reduce coercion and threat which were the agents determining the instability affecting the principles embodied in the Charter of our Organization  These thoughts lead the delegation of the Dominican Republic to mention the importance which my country attaches to the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution (XXIX)], which should not be left or considered a simple expression of purposes which have remained inoperative as so many others or which have been neglected despite the causes which led to it A review of the disturbances caused in the territories of States Members of the United Nations shows that violence in its most inhuman forms has not diminished but has rather increased and intensified considerably  We cannot deny that those facts have negative international implications such as the hijacking of aircraft, a subject which involves States with all the characteristics we know Seizing hostages is no doubt one of the most odious forms of violent coercion  Now this practice has spread to the Americas, where it has created threats to public order in the form of kidnappings which defy authority to obtain the objectives pursued, disregarding the fact that the victims are actually innocent personsand this makes these deeds barbarian crimes In this danger zone of crime in the international arena we must admit that the instruments available to us so far have been ineffective to prevent or punish violations which are contrary to moral and cultural progress, in contrast to the technology which is leading us to ever deeper penetration of outer space The General Assembly in previous years has been concerned with this serious situation, and the statements made on those occasions were so conservative that we could say today that they have been largely the cause of the evil we are now facing without any apparent remedy The frequency with which this type of violence occurs nil over the world makes a more thorough review necessary in order to find new, more effective instruments to check the proliferation of terrorism, hijacking and kidnapping, in all its forms, so that this evil may be halted before this covert method of warfare unleashes an international conflict which could lead to a new war It would not be an exaggeration to give priority to the idea of a preventive and corrective mechanism for this purpose, which has already been studied by the General Assembly  Preventive action may consist in the formula which is applicable to other cases similar to the ones we have mentioned  We think that time has come to consider terrorism to be an offense under ordinary law, taking into account not merely the motive, but the dreadful nature of the crime and the fact that its victims are innocent people  This would also provide the necessary means for the prevention and punishment of hijacking of aircraft, the holding of hostages etc  These specific offenses must be regarded as crimes against mankind, with all the legal consequences The Dominican Republic has attached special importance to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and within its possibilities has lent its decided cooperation toward the adoption of a draft convention that would be viable and effective  We understand that such a task is very difficult given the opposing interests in the world today  At the same time we are largely elaborating a new law of die sea which covers greater areas than the land masses  It is obvious, on the other hand, that many of the provisions which have been proposed compel us to abandon centuriesold practicesa matter which frequently requires uncommon decisiveness and firmness  However, the reasons leading States to find a new regime for the seas are so clear and convincingnow that we must speak no longer of a mare liberum, but rather of the common heritage of mankind that we must yield to the requirements of our time before it is too late This is a challenge which we cannot neglect, since the world is beset by prospects of food scarcity in particular, and the wealth of the sea is important for survival and human progress  No one can ignore the situation, which is linked, so to speak, to a fixed timetable  The realities have placed us in a state of siege We have been disappointed to see that on many of the subjects involved in the law of the sea not only have opposite positions been taken and this has disturbed recent meetings on the subjectbut they have also made impossible the adoption of agreed formulas and have delayed the possibility of agreeing on a convention that can be adopted on time, bearing in mind the urgent need to exploit the resources of the sea, while we move towards the year The reference to food shortages and malnutrition leads us to the resolution of the World Food Conference,  which is of great topical importance for the problem of hunger  It is difficult to conceive that despite the importance of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the oilproducing countries have not contributed to that mechanism for the mobilization of agriculture, at the levels required by the urgency of that program, the implementation of which would alleviate the demand for food in critical areas and reduce the devastation brought about by malnutrition It is clear that this problem is becoming more acute and spreading everywhere, and it is that continuous projection which remains a question to which no reply has so far been forthcoming on the basis of population growth forecasts and other statistics endorsed by competent organizations The Dominican Republic shares the concern over the need to make use of all available resources for agricultural production with a view to attaining the maximum possible level, i e , the need to act now with a view to preventing the ills that are threatening future generations  That is why the Government headed by His Excellency President Joaquin Balaguer, not only maintains a vigorous agricultural policy but has also been gradually changing the landholding regime so as to open up more opportunities in agriculture and in all other fields of production including miningan unprecedented change  The system which has been established for agrarian reform includes recovering State lands and gradually acquiring large tracts of arable land to be turned over to the farmers  These standards constitute a true bloodless revolution, the results of which will be found in the total economic development of the country through the use of all its natural resources Our delegation wishes to make special mention of the sessions of UNCTAD through which developing countries expect to receive the means which will vigorously com tribute to trade and development  This recognition leads us to hope for the best results from a world economic survey as well as an analysis of the prospects for the second half with regard to means to speed up the transfer of real resources to developing countries on a secure, foreseeable and permanent basis We share the idea that the time has come to introduce reforms into the Charter of the Organization  We understand that instruments relating to world order must be revised from time to time in the light of experience  Also, and for the same reason relating to changes in the life of nations, new forecasts made mandatory by the facts of international life must be incorporated into the ordering of the objectives brought about by the constitution of our system We must admit that some of the difficulties we are faced with are the result of some existing principles or of the lack of others; we must admit that these abnormalities should be largely attributed to the States themselves owing to the alternatives of international politics or to the fact that States do not subject themselves to existing principles There is very little marble that has no imperfections, says the dictum, and we can therefore say that no human endeavor is perfect  Hence we can state that if the United Nations is imperfect the same applies to the States that constitute it  There is therefore no reason for despair That being understood, it follows that the task we have before us requires the firm will to make the Charter more effective and worthy of respect so that it will always condition the objectives for which it was established on the basis of the experience of total war, whose consequences still to some extent weigh on our present civilization There is a new manifestation of discrimination no less detrimental to mankind than those which involve the economy of States  Economic discrimination leads to distrust and to fear in the States which are affected  This risks bringing about controversies and may disturb peace placing in jeopardy the basic objectives of the Charter of the Organization There is the risk of having a type of economic totalitarianism which would upset the international balance  It distorts the economy and applies great but unforeseeable pressureseven a kind of slaveryon the peoples directly affected  That evil should disappear since we are convinced that today the idea of domination is being replaced by that of the common heritage of mankind In addition to the realities which lead us to recognize that we are still suffering from a crisis in a law, we have the crisis in international cooperation, which may be in a covert form, and, furthermore, impedes the necessary assistance among States under the essential principle of universality for the world Organization It seems that the oil crisis engendered by inflation in development centers is becoming a regressive phenomenon with inevitable characteristics, and it is occurring precisely at a time when the forecast is that the problems of population growth, unemployment and malnutrition will have doubled by the end of this century, while on the other hand production will not suffice to meet the demand for food and alleviate the tragedy of hunger  Hunger is the war that can unleash war  We should therefore like to offer statements of the greatest importance for our delegation  We refer to the problem of the sugar markets whose ups and downs since have been of extraordinary importance for the economy of many exporting countries, our own among them The history of the efforts made in order to stabilize basic commodities would take too long even to summarize  On the other hand, it is well known by all, and therefore we need not recount what has occurred hitherto  Rather, we would like to start from now and to look for solutions that are positive, just and mutually advantageous for exporting countries as well as for importers  The former wish to have security with regard to surplus supplies and their consequential depressing effect on prices  The latter need protection from scarcity and violently inflationary prices  Consequently it would seem that the obstacles to a harmonious marketing of many raw materials and sugar is a case in pointdepend on hew the parties interpret that is just and reasonable, and we must admit that it is not easy to attain unanimity on definitions  It is, however, a challenge, and the best opportunity available to mankind today to take the initiative on a subject as vital as international commodity agreements, if we wish to attain positive facts free from that endless rhetoric to which we are used, is international cooperation which is meaningful to producers, consumers, exporters and importers One of those agreements can be envisaged  UNCTAD has already set in motion the convening of an International Sugar Conference for April  There are many documents ready for the preparatory work and experts have examined in detail the possibilities of laying down the basis to eliminate from the resulting convention the concept of exploiters and exploited, which would be frustrating for all parties First of all we think it essential to maintain a certain relationship between production costs and prices in the light of the results obtained by the efficient producers  In this regard we should point out that production costs, for totally extraneous reasons which have nothing to do with the recognized efficiency of some producers, haveas is the case of our countryincreased for entirely extraneous reasons  It is a fact that, due to the influence of the higher oil prices and the inflationary trends prevailing all over the world, the cost of the input essential to produce sugar and other consumer goods has risen astronomically  In a document presented some months ago to the International Sugar Organization there is a comparison, as an example, between the costs of these goods in and the costs in  For example, fertilizers in some instances went up from $to $per metric tonper cent in the case of ureaand in others from $to $ The price of super phosphate tripled  Herbicides, according to the same chart, have generally doubled in price, and the same can be said of some equipment  Oil f o b  the Persian Gulf increased from $to $ These are figures taken at random but they are quite representative for our purposes here It is thus obvious that maintaining price levels for sugar and other export commodities similar to those prevailing at the beginning of this decade would be, and they are indeed right now, simply ruinous to the countries whose national income and whose balanceofpayments depends substantially on them  It is in the light of this situation fraught with serious consequences for the development and the wellbeing of the less developed nations that we must in a broad spirit of international solidarity focus on the search for a solution which can and must be found within the framework of the negotiations towards a new International Sugar Agreement  However, pending the adoption of a new international instrument on this subject we must adopt measures which would henceforth prevent a greater disruption in the international prices of sugar Inestimable and adverse consequences arise when world sugar production and consumption, according to the best estimates available, barely amount the million short tons without any great surpluses to depress prices  We car safely say that in the present world situation, where there are such pressing needs, to speak of a sugar surplus is most erroneous That is why we are faced with a situation which we thought had been superseded and would not be repeated, since we believed that market forces would moderate the traditional sharp rises and drops which have frequently curbed the expansion and prosperity of one of the most strategic industries in the agricultural sector in this century  Furthermore, we thought that sugar cane production was no longer one more raw material widely marketed throughout the world  That concept has been superseded owing to the production of valuable byproducts obtained in the industrialization process The many applications of sugar cane byproducts in modern industry, which lacks essential raw materials, made it impossible to think that an asset of that magnitude would not with a full expansion of the world economy respond to the real demands for all these goods  However, since the real forces of the market have not taken over, the industries of many exporting countries are being forced into bankruptcy, since, because of declining prices, they will have to cut back production acreage, not process existing crops, close down their factories and declare bankruptcy  However, after the contraction has been fully felt, after marginal producers have been eliminated, and after the supply of what appears to be surpluses has been reduced, prices will again rise, consumer countries will be increasingly concerned and will lift import restrictions, encourage the use of sweeteners, offer incentives to domestic production and resort to marketing mechanisms to depress prices  It is shameful that in this century we, producers and consumers alike, are so incapable of preventing this game from playing itself out in front of everyone without taking into account that not only the interests of poor countries are included but also the very sustenance of thousands of workers, their economic and political stability and above all the supply of foodstuffs for human consumption Our delegation sincerely believes in the goodwill of countries represented here to coordinate their interests at this crucial moment in the history of mankind  In this regard we think it pertinent to express in general lines the position of the Dominican Republic on this very important matter, for the destiny of our countries and in general for the world in which we have to live In the annual report submitted to the National Assembly on February the President of the Republic, Mr  Joaquin Balaguer, defined the position of our country with regard to the meeting which was to be held in Puerto Plata by the group of sugarexporting countries of Latin America and the Caribbean as follows and I quote:“In effect, in the same manner in which the increase in the price of oil and its derivatives disrupted even the economy of industrialized nations, an excessive hike in our export products, such as sugar or coffee, could wreak havoc on the economy of countries which may be forced to acquire those products on extremely hard terms “The best contribution that could be made by the Latin American countries which export their raw materials to the highly industrialized countries of the area would be not to aggravate, through a disproportionate increase in their raw materials, the crisis brought about by the rise in the prices of oil and its derivatives  It would be preferable for consumer and producer countries alike to reach an agreement establishing fair prices for sugar, coffee, cocoa, etc  These new prices must be set at levels which allow developing countries to pay the high price brought today by the fuel needed to run their economy, and which enable consumer countries to obtain Latin American raw materials at prices which are acceptable and equitable for both parties\""

       "\"had the united nations not been faced in its five years of existence with countless obstacles, had it not been called upon to deal with so many alarming symptoms in the historical development of a convalescent world, it would be difficult to justify its creation, to welcome its birth and to hang on it, as men hoist a banner to a masthead, the hopes of peace and security of a profoundly disturbed epoch  the fact is that the struggle which this young yet already sorely tried organization has waged, and is still waging, is the best proof of the timeliness of its conception and creation, and of the urgent and imperious need for the work it is doing today certainly this has not been merely another episode in the political history of the peoples  the recent wars, with their unparalleled violence and enormous destructive power, engendered in the peoples a boundless desire for peace, concord and agreement  that is why the united nations (united for agreement, concord and peace) neither can nor should be regarded as one of those familiar panaceas created for interested motives in international political laboratories with the object of providing temporary compromise solutions for more or less selfish problems; it must be recognized for what it is, a sacred idea conceived by the peoples at a time of grave and legitimate struggle for the permanent protection of their democratic existence, autonomy, dignity, peace and security for these reasons it is a crime to obstruct it in its sacred mission  it is a crime to try to reduce it to a tool of selfish ideologies  it is a crime to use it as an instrument of war in times of peace  it is a crime not to render it due honour “we the peoples of the united nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war…” thus reads the opening sentence of the preamble of the united nations charter  yet, today one of these nations, “determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” is violated and invaded by violent and brutal forces bent on extermination — the extermination of a people and of a nationality  i need hardly say that i am referring to the democratic republic of south korea in the degrading scale of interventions, unjust and injurious interventions by armed force marks the nadir below the zero of international politics  i belong to a country whose deepest and most prolonged historical afflictions have been painfully rooted in the most varied types of intervention  the dominican republic, with its experience of the martyrdom of intervention, is in a position to appreciate to the full the tragedy which the people of south korea is suffering but what democratic people, even if it has itself never been the victim of treacherous aggression, can fail to have repudiated and condemn such an unprecedented and criminal outrage  the united nations, composed of peoples which wish to be peoples, of men who strive to be men in the highest sense of the word, has taken on behalf of its members the stand dictated in all of us by the deeprooted instinct of selfpreservation and the supreme and universally felt desire not to let foul aggression go unpunished by its energetic, resolute, unequivocal and united action, the united nations has saved the faith of mankind in the principles of peace, and has taught the aggressors an eloquent lesson the blood now being shed by the american soldiers is redeeming the ideal of the united nations — the ideal of peaceful possession and enjoyment of security  for the first time in history the community of nations has taken the decisive step of waging a victorious war on war  never has such a tribute been rendered to peace, for never before has the conscience of mankind been so united in the face of brutal aggression  let this object lesson serve as a formal warning to aggressors everywhere, whether they be violators of the national rights of others or merely ideological aggressors; for any moral aggressor is potentially a military aggressor the dominican republic takes this opportunity to reaffirm its intention to offer its full cooperation and, as far as its resources permit, to assume its full share of the sacrifices necessary for the complete triumph of this just united nations undertaking  this is not the first time — let us hope it may be the last — that my country, though not one of the greatest or most powerful, has calmly and bravely faced an unequal fight for the right, resolute and conscientious in the performance of its duty before leaving this rostrum i should like to refer to a different matter connected with the united nations  the question of the relations between member states of the united nations and spain was placed on the agenda of the fifth session of the general assembly at the initiative of the dominican republic [a/ apart from the reasons imposed by the logic of history and the irresistible force of tradition; apart from the historic heritage which has implanted in the soul of peoples a strong feeling of filial respect mingled with manly and honourable gratitude; apart from the fact that the dominican republic, as the firstborn, wished by its action to express a desire rooted deep down in the national instinct of some twenty sister countries; apart from all this, the dominican republic was guided by two more immediate and realistic considerations, more timely and practical, when it asked the general assembly first to consider and later to approve the resumption of normal and traditional relations between member states of the united nations and spain these two considerations are, first, the sincere desire to point out — so that it may be taken into consideration — that there has been a change in world public opinion in favour of such relations since resolution (i) was adopted on december  and, secondly, the fervent wish to contribute to this world organization a new and constructive element of unity and agreement, an element which is the more necessary and desirable at a time v/hen gales, blowing from a quarter we all know, are threatening to strip the petals off this white rose of peace which is called the united nations charter the dominican republic trusts that it is not alone in hoping for the adoption of this constructive and just proposal which, just and constructive as it is, it has submitted as a tribute to united nations unity  at the outset, i would like to congratulate ambassador maría fernanda espinosa garcés on her election as president of the general assembly and to wish her every possible success  it is a great honour for me to be able to once again address the assembly as president of the dominican republic  this is a special occasion for our country, because next year the dominican republic will sit on the security council as a nonpermanent member for the first time on behalf of  the dominican people and myself,    i would therefore like to start by thanking the states members of the united nations for the support we have received in joining the security council  in particular, i thank the members of the group of latin american and caribbean states for the trust placed in us  our purpose during our term will be to contribute a voice for latin america and the caribbean to one of the forums for greater  global responsibility  in   the   maintenance of peace of course, we are committed to asserting, both in the security council and in the assembly, the same unbreakable principles that guide us as a nation  respect for human rights, democracy, freedom and diversity will therefore be the beacon that we will follow in order to guide our work in the security council  we will do everything possible to honour the trust placed in us, being fully aware that, although fragile, stability and security are priority objectives that must be preserved and progress made towards, step by step and day by day it is clear to us that in a space that addresses issues that can change the course of history and the fate of millions of people, we cannot seek easy and drastic solutions, which in any case do not exist  in that context, our country will always be a place of dialogue and understanding, and will always seek peaceful solutions  we are always willing to do whatever it takes to find common ground and support consensus as the best tool for peace and development  we will therefore always promote rapprochement among peoples through mediation and democratic dialogue, opening spaces for a future of shared peace since its founding more than seven decades ago, the united nations has played a central role in creating a more stable and secure world for human beings across the globe  however, we can never consider stability a definitive achievement  we cannot lower our guard when we know, for example, that in our latin american and caribbean region alone, per cent of the population belongs to the socalled vulnerable class and could therefore fall back into poverty when faced with any setback by the same token, it is fair to recognize that like so many other things, security is not well distributed  we all know that there are territories in the americas and in many other places around the world where the prospect of living peacefully and without fear is an almost utopian vision, due to the control that organized crime exercises in those territories what can we do, then, to make this a more stable world  what measures can we implement to ensure that security is not solely the asset of a select few countries, but one that extends throughout the world and reaches every neighbourhood and village  of  course,  i  am not the only one asking those questions — everyone here has asked them at some point — nor will i give definitive answers, which can be formulated and found only by working together  what i will do is briefly mention what i consider two of the main threats to global stability and security  i am referring to climate change and drug trafficking and organized crime at first glance, they may seem very different from each other, but their complexity and global scope makes them two of the main challenges  facing humankind  in both cases, the consequences are the destruction of thousands of families, collateral damage to all aspects of human development and the overwhelming of states by the magnitude of the challenges they face let us start by talking about the consequences of natural disasters, which are occurring more and more frequently  we only have to open the newspaper or turn on the television to see the effects of climate change wreaking havoc somewhere on the planet  from thetyphoon that recently hit the philippines, the strongest in decades, to the hurricane seasons that punish the caribbean islands with increasing ferocity, no corner of the world is safe  last year we saw hurricane irma leave havana totally flooded, and it took many weeks for things to return to normal  meanwhile, in puerto rico, antigua and barbuda and other caribbean islands, it has taken months to recover from the effects of hurricane maria, which not only brought about economic losses but also claimed a considerable number of human lives in the dominican republic, we are strongly committed to dealing with the consequences of climate change  that means that we are working simultaneously on three levels of action, local, national and international  it is at the local level where people’s daily lives develop   it  is  there  that  tragedies  take on a painful reality and where the work of building, preparing and raising awareness must begin it is at the local and national levels where our government has a greater capacity to act and where we are improving resilience and relocating the communities that live around our most significant watersheds, which are highly vulnerable to meteorological events   we are also doing a great deal of public awareness work and training thousands of  teachers  and  technicians to promote sustainable development in their schools and communities then there is the national level, where  we  are also working tirelessly, both on our rapidresponse strategies and in the field of prevention  for instance, we are planting millions of trees across our country and investing more than ever before in renewable energy  those measures will not only support our economy, they will enable us to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases by per cent by  a goal that we are very pleased about however, the fight against climate change is  a task for all of us, and that is why the next level — the international level — is the broadest and most essential of the three  if there is no political will in this area, most of our efforts will come to nothing and will have a negative impact on all the progress we  have  made  at the local and national levels  that is why i would like to reiterate once again before the assembly the importance of going beyond good intentions and focusing on concrete actions among those actions, i want to once again highlight the urgency of financing and making operational initiatives such as the warsaw international mechanism for loss and damage associated with climate change impacts, which will make it possible to compensate for the destruction of infrastructure and ecosystems and alleviate the threatening conditions of our residents  that fund is essential to ensuring that natural disasters do not destroy in a few hours what many nations have spent decades building i will give one example, on  the  understanding that our case is not the most tragic in the caribbean region  last year, the storms olga and maria spelled the destruction of more than $billion worth of infrastructure  imagine what that means for a country whose annual state budget is already limited  above all, the warsaw fund will help protect the valuable lives of millions of human beings, bringing them peace of mind for their homes and granting them a future without a constant uncertain feeling of threat every time they see that rain is coming  we therefore consider it indisputable that those countries that have most heavily contributed to the gas emissions that are responsible for climate change are also those that should contribute proportionally to the  fund  established  to  mitigate its effects as i described earlier, we also consider drug trafficking and organized crime to be a threat to global security and stability of a similar magnitude to that of climate change  the trafficking of illicit substances claims  thousands  of  lives  every  year,  particularly of young people,  who  are  extremely  valuable  to our countries  as if that were not bad enough, drug trafficking also permeates our institutions, unbalances our economies, threatens our values and brings nothing but degradation and destruction to our social fabric  wherever organized crime prevails, the security and peace of our peoples always deteriorate over time  as with climate change, therefore, the fight against drugs must be conducted at all three levels — local, national and international — in order to achieve effective results in the case of our country, local intervention is focused on prevention campaigns and educating our young people by supporting them with training and entrepreneurial opportunities, while also improving the neighbourhoods where they live and recovering public spaces for people to use  we do all of that with the aim of saving the most vulnerable populations from criminal networks at the national level, our security forces and national drug control directorate are  working  all over the country as part of a comprehensive plan to strengthen our actions against drug trafficking  among other initiatives, we are acquiring new, hightech equipment and strengthening security at our ports and airports with more agents and security checks, as well as carrying out indepth interventions in areas with the highest incidence of crime  in parallel, we have moved forward with the enactment of a law against money laundering and the financing of terrorism, based on the recommendations of the financial action task force, with an emphasis on preventing and combating money laundering, which drug traffickers use to ensure the profitability of their activities finally, at the international level, we have bilateral and multilateral agreements in place with the united states, the european union and the countries of the central american integration system, as well as participating in the caribbean basin security initiative, all with the objective of coordinating efforts and improving our efficiency in combating drug trafficking and organized crime  thanks to such initiatives, we are better prepared to fight together against that evil, which threatens the integrity of our economies and our democracies  however, we must emphasize the need for greater international coordination we can make great strides forward if we join our efforts, share information and support each other in our work  we also understand that showing greater commitment is the responsibility of countries that due to their domestic demand for narcotics, have set in motion the international machinery of drug trafficking and organized crime  we  cannot ignore the fact that  it is the developing states that act as the first barrier in containing drug trafficking, thereby protecting the most developed countries our countries allocate billions of dollars each year to fulfilling that role, but it is never enough in the face of the huge resources deployed by organized crime networks  that is undoubtedly a key factor in the social disintegration that many of our countries are dealing with  as in the case of climate change, it is the more developed countries with greater consumption capacity that must dedicate more resources, cooperation and political will if they truly wish to fight the problem with any hope of victory  in combating the effects of drug trafficking and climate change, we will address some of the structural causes of deeper poverty and social inequality  if the united nations and the developed countries want to help fight poverty more comprehensively and openly, those two fronts are an intelligent, humane and cost effective way to do so  we once again appeal to those countries from this rostrum to show the responsibility and solidarity we need to make our planet a safer place climate change, drug trafficking, poverty, social inequality and mass migration are all interrelated problems that we must deal with urgently  as we have pointed out today, the best and perhaps only way to do that is to act at all levels of response to the problem, so that the agreements we sign in a forum like the united nations have a real impact on the lives of the people, and so that the needs of our peoples are articulated in their national and international institutions we must therefore all continue to act according to our capacities, without hesitation and with the same objective of creating a world that is increasingly stable, secure and developed, a world in which all men and women can carry forward their life dreams  that is the ultimate goal that the dominican republic will continue to work for  we will do it in our towns, neighbourhoods and all of our cities; with our immediate neighbours and with all members of the general assembly; and in the security council next year, in the new role that we will be honoured to assume       may i begin my speech, mr  president, by conveying to you on behalf of the delegation of the dominican republic our heartiest congratulations on your election to preside over the deliberations of this twentyfirst session of the general assembly     these sentiments also express our conviction that you will guide our labours so wisely yet so firmly that we can even now anticipate the chorus of praise and recognition from the delegations here present at the success of your noble efforts, in the high position you occupy by the vote of this assembly, to achieve peace and the solution of the problems facing us     it is not with empty words of vainglory or boasting, but backed by the exact not to say strict expression of historical truth, that i state that never in the history of the united nations has there appeared before a meeting of the general assembly a delegation of the dominican republic possessing credentials of such remarkable political value as those displayed by the delegation which i have the honour to lead     born out of elections in which the dominican people gave vigorous and unequivocal support to the programme of the victorious party in a contest whose legality and fairness were vouched for by impartial observers representing various trends of contemporary political and social thought, the government of mr  joaquin balaguer, which i have the honour to represent at this rostrum, embodies in the most positive manner the people aspirations for justice and progress and guarantees my country complete identification with the united nation profession of faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person     as a fortunate result of representations made by the dominican republic in the organization of american states, the interamerican peace force, stationed in my country as a sequel to the painful events which filled the republic with grief and ruin, was withdrawn  my government then approached the secretarygeneral of the united nations in order that the mandate of may for the despatch of a representative to the dominican republic might be duly revoked, since the free elections have fulfilled the basic aims of the tenth meeting of consultation of ministers for foreign affairs of the organization of american states held in washington on may  to solve within the american national ambit the grave political crisis then disturbing the dominican republic     the fundamental prerequisite for the existence of a state of law in a country has been satisfactorily fulfilled in the dominican republic  i can add categorically that this state of law is being progressively consolidated, even in the midst of the tensions which are only to be expected in the light of the tragic process of moral decline and decay of the state authority which has characterized the dominican republic recent struggle for existence     it is not enough to asset that a state of law exists in the dominican republic; we must also stress the feeling of real democratic coexistence which the present administration is striving to imprint upon dominican public life  despite the impressive margin of votes obtained in the elections of june of this year, the new dominican government has not arrogated to itself, so to speak, a monopoly of the victor spoils  in accordance with its policy of political enlightenment, which it felt duty bound to put into effect on assuming a mandate which it had undertaken to exercise not on behalf of a political party but on behalf of the community, the present dominican administration is today joined in the enterprise of government with all men and women capable of contributing to the rehabilitation of dominican public life regardless of their individual political affiliation     my government believes that it is an essential requirement for domestic peace to accept the fact that we are a heterogeneous political society, the various sectors of which, far from being excluded, must on the contrary participate in the joint effort needed for the salvation of the country  naturally, this recognition that all must share in the common task involves not only rights but also, and above all, duties and responsibilities  the delegation with which i share the proud duties entrusted to me is a clear reflection on this courageous and strict understanding of the exigencies of our national policy  its representative character is guaranteed by the presence within it of a distinguished member of the opposition in the national congress and of important leaders and authorized spokesmen of other authentically democratic party forces     nevertheless, the consolidation of the state of law is not the only fundamental preoccupation of the present dominican administration  we have also embarked with equal determination on the creation of a state of economic and social security, as is shown by the clear social trend of the new government development plans; we are also improving public morality with the help of the disciplined sense of honesty and austerity which the new dominican administration has infused into the task of government     important considerations affecting the maintenance of peace and security in the american continent will make it clear that the present dominican experiment in democracy, because of the quality and intensity of the effort devoted to it, merits the sympathetic interest of the united nations and in particular of those powers which, within and outside the american continent, are making a genuine effort to create the conditions which are needed, in the words of the charter, to promote throughout the world social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom     the alternative is fraught with the most catastrophic possibilities  if this experiment designed to initiate the dominican republic into the practice of civilized political coexistence were to be destroyed by the violent reaction of those who do not agree with this type of community, it would not be hard to prophesy that the legal vacuum thus created would be filled by foreign intervention or by a dictatorship which would crush public freedom and delay social progress  thus we should suffer a permanent set back in our promising career as a nation endowed with resources enough to ensure it a prosperous and happy life     my government greatly appreciates the spirit of international cooperation in which our efforts are being encouraged, and it has instructed me to convey from this rostrum our gratitude for the moral and economic aid which we are receiving from friendly nations  i should like in particular to refer to the decision of the united states government to grant the dominican republic an increase in its sugar quota on the north american market, in all, an addition of about tons, which has had a most stimulating effect on the dominican economy     the policy of financing the economic and social development plans of the developing countries will certainly be supported in the dominican republic by the strictest and most farreaching controls  otherwise, the provision of international assistance for development purposes would be like trying to fill the bottomless cask of the danaides     this means that we refuse, because we think it economically frustrating and morally humiliating, to go on stagnating as we were up to a short time ago, in conditions very like those of the colony of t«in domingo in the days of its decline, when the lives of dominicans were spent sadly awaiting the arrival of the galleons bearing the colonial subsidy     as president ralaguer stated categorically when taking the oath of office on july  economic assistance used mainly to repair budgetary errors and correct omissions in the implementation of the public expenditure act resulting from the administrative disorder in which we have been living is more of a disservice than an effective contribution to our programme to improve national institutions  in the face of this practice, the dominican republic has reversed its stand completely  we prefer aid which will help us to cease to be an economic parasite dependent on foreign aid  in short, the people of the dominican republic share the desire common to all worthy peoples and all honourable men, to earn a living by the sweat of their brow     the increase in the dominican sugar quota on the united states market heralds a new era in the economic relations between the two countries  for the first time, these relations are being considered in a completely realistic light  heartening prospects will open up, if this step, which is only the first along the right path, is consolidated and followed by other agreements of even greater potential for the prosperity of the dominican republic within its geographical area     from the rio grande to the straits of magellan, through the immense crescent of central america and the caribbean, we see profound changes taking place among a group of nations which have reached another crucial moment in their destiny  we see the awakening of human multitudes who were until a little time ago simply the pawns of history, but who now understand that they are in the front rank of those abstract conceptions known as states, which until recently were considered as being the principle subjects of law, geography and history  it can no longer be denied that the men and women of these lands — indeed, human beings everywhere — with their achievements, their miseries, their rebellions and their hopes, are the real concern of economics, law, education and politics     evidence of the presence of the masses in the life of contemporary societies is copious and pressing  latin america is no stranger to these anxieties and to the social problems of immense human communities ravaged by poverty  sociological geography tells us that just as there is a geography of hunger there is also a geography of disease, a geography of ignorance, a geography, in short, of man’s inhumanity to man  it also tells us that there are, both at the national and at the international level in our continent, two americas, which may be distinguished by names different from those on the map; one is known as the affluent society, the other the society of the dispossessed, and between them there is a failure of communication, a lack of interchange, that is reflected in a constant rise in the living standards of the former and a steady decline in those of the latter     in this situation, the peoples of america are faced with two alternatives; they can choose the brutal, leveling process of revolution, which is supposed to solve their social problems but at the expense of freedom; or they can find in the system of hemispheric cooperation the political and moral values, the procedures and standards, which, once brought up to date, will enable them to achieve by working together in the economic and social fields the objectives of the confederation of bolivar, that sacred source of all our relationships     there can be no doubt that responsible opinion in the americas has decided to opt for the second of these alternatives which responds to the imperatives of the history of the american people and to the concepts of their institutional life     the minds and wills of those who govern the americas are inspired by a great ideal: the new plans for hemispheric economic integration offer the american peoples a future of unprecedented prosperity     the dominican republic shares in the legitimate interest awakened by these projects, the effective realization of which will be the start of a new epoch in american relations  at the same time it believes it necessary to make a number of comments on hemispheric economic integration in so far as it affects the situation of the dominican republic as a geographical and economic unit of the caribbean region     the dominican government believes that, in view of the time already spent in considering the advantages of the rapid economic integration of the democratic areas of the caribbean and in view of dominican economic potentialities in relation to the neighbouring island of puerto rico, the time has now come to take decisive steps to that end  as president balaguer said on taking the oath of office, conditions are excellent for both countries to establish a kind of common market, and to organize their respective economies in a spirit of mutual cooperation  santo domingo could provide puerto rico with an infinite number of agricultural products which are not produced in large enough quantities by the latter, and both peoples could join together in many fields of economic development so that their combined capital could promote industrial development in the field of private investment     twentyfive years ago, the distinguished puerto rican economist, carlos chardon, put forward in his book viajes y naturaleza some highly stimulating ideas which the passage of time has only made more cogent and compelling  in this work, it is argued that of all the groups of islands which exist in the world, only the archipelago of the antilles has been unable to achieve a socalled archipelago economy because in this group of islands there are seven sovereign governments as far apart economically as they are geographically     chardon says that the island region of the caribbean may be defined economically as a typical food deficit zone apparently, a state of affairs which is growing worse because of the constantly rising population  this distinguished puerto rican scholar observes, however, that in this situation the dominican republic offers the characteristics of a country which, because of the diversity of its crops and its great potential for agricultural development, constitutes the natural supplier of food products to this geographical region     a study entitled data which suggest the economic integration of part of the caribbean area, prepared by mr  chardon for the development bank of puerto rico, was published in november  this admirable analysis substantiated the fundamental considerations that since have justified the plan, conceived in the terms i have briefly outlined  in this study, the author, after a detailed analysis of dominican economic potential as compared with that of puerto rico, reaches the conclusion that of eight economic benchmarks seven are positive and one temporarily negative for the dominican republic, while for the island of puerto rico, two of these same benchmarks are positive and six negative  he therefore feels that the economies of the dominican republic and puerto rico are complementary and that the two islands can achieve what he calls an unprecedented form of social symbiosis  according to the study in question, dominican agricultural potential is twelve times greater than that of puerto rico  we may imagine what levels of production the dominican republic would obtain if its economy received the extraordinary additional incentive of integration within the triangle of freer trade relations with the united states of america and puerto rico     recently, significant talks were held in santo domingo with representatives of puerto rican trade and industry, which constitute a beginning in the process of bringing the economic interests of the two islands together  it is obvious, however, that these talks must be supplemented by negotiations at the governmental level between the appropriate authorities, with a view to the conclusion of wideranging agreements covering all the matters involved in an economic merger equivalent to a common market,    although the increase in the dominican sugar quota on the north american market is undoubtedly highly satisfactory, this step should not be looked upon as temporary assistance to the dominican republic during what might be called its period of convalescence from the recent national crisis  the dominican republic hopes to find in the united states the necessary will to collaborate, in order to stabilize and develop its economic relations in the geographical area which it occupies jointly with the united states, bearing in mind the potentialities of its natural resources     the dominican republic has no desire to remain indefinitely in a state of complete dependence on external credit, no matter how generous the terms on which it is offered  even in the midst of our present problems, the dominican government is determined to carry out its plans for economic rehabilitation and development by embarking on the difficult course of valiant effort and arduous sacrifice  our aim is to achieve once more a healthy economy buttressed by the respectability of our democratic institutions which constitute its animating spirit  we are working not only for our own benefit but also in order to contribute as much as we can to the assistance of other peoples and to all the causes of social and humanitarian interest sponsored by the united nations     the dominican delegation has noted with interest that the agenda of this session of the general assembly contains the item relating to the draft covenants on human rights  the preparation of these instruments is a most notable attempt to reconcile the contradiction between the vital interests of states and the universalist vocation of an international organization such as ours  in contemporary” international society, these instruments assume an extraordinary importance  they establish a higher tribunal, designed to humanize the function of government and ensure the international protection of human rights  this protective function is thus removed from subjective considerations of national policy which tend to distort it     we cannot but feel ourselves fully identified with the juridical technique adopted by the united nations to secure the international protection of human rights  in ordinary situations, apart from those cases of grave and systematic violations of human rights which must remain within the direct competence of the general assembly, the dominican government believes that the protection of human rights, whether jurisdictional or quasijurisdictional, should be entrusted to special bodies set up by virtue of treaties and conventions  nevertheless, my government’s attitude as regards the immediate effectiveness of these agreements is one of caution  we are aware that the european convention on human rights of and its additional protocol of  which must be approved and ratified by the national parliaments of the contracting parties, are still not fully effective in all their provisions and for all the contracting states, although these instruments apply to a homogeneous political civilization  it can easily be foreseen, then that the united nations covenants on civil and political rights and on humanitarian and social rights will need still more time for complete and effective implementation     the dominican government has also noted with particular interest, among the social items on this assembly’s agenda, that relating to a draft declaration on the elimination of discrimination against women  the presence of women in dominican political and civil life on a footing of complete equality with men and their influence as a sane and conciliating factor in the political struggle has been so effective in the recent elections that women have gained positions in the governments of the twentysix provinces into which the territory of the dominican republic is politically divided     my government also wishes to state that if there is any one violation of human rights which cries out in the sight of god and which must inevitably evoke in the conscience of the world the most overwhelming repugnance, it is that which perpetuates discriminatory practices on racial grounds  the dominican delegation will strongly support the repeated condemnation of these practices by the general assembly, practices that dishonour the nations which are responsible for them and which, far from making sincere efforts to eradicate them once and for all, stubbornly persist in enshrining them, as it were, in their political constitution     the dominican delegation will also support any votes to censure adopted by this assembly against manifestations of national and religious intolerance and will vote in favour of the speedy completion of the draft convention on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance     on behalf of the government and delegation of the dominican republic, i extend hearty greetings to the new state of guyana, on the occasion of its entry into the united nations  i am sure that it will contribute to the realization of our organization fundamental goals, and to that end we assure it of the dominican government desire to cooperate     as in previous years, the question of peacekeeping throughout the world is the most important general subject of our session     the charter of the united nations requires member states to practise tolerance and to live in peace as good neighbours, as a means of attaining the noble aims of our organization  to live and let live would undoubtedly be the most reasonable corollary of that basic provision of the charter, naturally we would not go so far as to affirm with menendez pelayo, the author of la historia de los heterodoxos espanoles” that intolerance is a state of health, but it is undoubtedly true that the world is witnessing a struggle between new orthodoxies and heresies which unfortunately we still have not only to live with but also to confront with needed definitions  our real task is to reestablish certain values which cannot be regarded as the transitory concerns of a particular epoch, but are part and parcel of all that is most noble and essential in human nature  in these circumstances, peace cannot be regarded as a kind of nirvana where the most virile and generous impulses of mankind dwindle into nothingness, for otherwise we would be admitting that all those provisions of the charter which promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms would be no more than meaningless sounds or empty legal phrases     when socalled dialectical reasoning with its essentially relativist criterion of values and its cataclysmic interpretation of history maintains that irreconcilable conflict, the synthesis of opposing ideas through systematic violence, the occurrence of historical changes on the universal plane, are the only valid premises of international relations, it is clear that situations must arise outside the united nations which cannot be reconciled with the principles upheld by our organization     one aspect of peacekeeping in which the dominican government has a lively interest is that relating to the defence of democratic institutions, in so far as this concept involves not only economic and social values but also political and moral values which cannot be renounced  it is in the light of this conviction that we regard the struggle in which the heroic people of south vietnam are involved in defence of their freedom and security  as far as the dominican government is concerned, the support which the government of the united states of america and other governments in that area which are vitally interested in the preservation of democracy in south vietnam are giving to that nation has our confidence and merits our respect     faithful to the interamerican peaceloving tradition, to the creation of which it has made a distinguished contribution through its resolute and persevering support of compulsory arbitration and the peaceful settlement of international disputes in general, the dominican republic is aware of the wellfounded anxiety aroused by the situation in south east asia, which moves all countries to deep feelings of pity     for all these reasons, it was with great satisfaction that we listened to the peace proposals submitted to this assembly by mr  goldberg on behalf of the government of the united states of america  in our opinion, they should be given careful consideration by those interested in peace with justice and dignity in vietnam     we appreciate and firmly support, as a duty not only of conscience but of religion, the enlightened efforts which his holiness pope paul vi has been exerting for some time now to bring about an end to this war, the prolongation of which, in the view of many, may lead to unrestrained action which might aggravate the present international situation     we also want to add our good wishes to those which secretarygeneral u thant has already received from our assembly in recognition of his noble and untiring work for peace  his decision to continue at the head of the secretariat of the united nations gives my country particular pleasure     as a member of the american family of nations we cannot but reaffirm our attitude towards the decisive questions which are at stake in the vietnamese war for the basic causes of that terrible conflict are the same as those which may one day arise in america  they will have similar implications if we do nothing in the face of the systematic campaign to subvert american democratic institution  this campaign is encouraged and supported with every kind of material and psychological resource by a state which, having deserted the international community that nurtured the ideals and the forces to which it owes its very existence, now dedicates itself to the task of sowing the seeds of its madness through the length and breath of the americas     the economic doctrine of laissezfaire, which led to the iron law of wages and which has been radically revised by modern economic thinking, must fail also as a political dogma  instead of a united nations resigned to the fatality of historical processes, we wish to see a united nations valiantly determined to reaffirm the eternal values of human dignity and the selfdetermination of peoples, provided that the latter is not invoked to justify yet another adventure of tyranny and aggression  the systematic recurrence of certain items on the agenda of our general assembly, such as those relating to the defence of peace against aggression, the struggle against racial discrimination and the last vestiges of colonialism, and the protection of human rights, demonstrate the unswerving will of our organization to watch over these serious matters  this is the spirit which keeps alive the interest of mankind in this organization whose profession of faith in these troubled times might perhaps be summed up in this motto of the founder of one of the smallest but most honoured constitutional monarchies of europe: we need no hope to start the battle, nor victory to persevere  mr  president, before beginning my statement on behalf of the delegation of the dominican republic i should like to express in this general assembly the great sorrow which overwhelms the government and people of the dominican republic at the tragedy which our sister republic of honduras is living through  honduras which; in this period of its history, is making extraordinary efforts to achieve progress on the road towards development, at this time suddenly has to face the violent forces of destiny  there has been practically total destruction as though an apocalyptic hand wanted to plunge it into despair  but that is why we are all here, the sister republics of honduras, meeting in this international forum so that we may here raise our voices and help in an effective manner the families which are at this time living through terrible anxiety  we express our solidarity with and condolences to honduras the dominican republic, which takes pride in being one of the founding members of the united nations, has always paid its tribute of faith to the principles of the organization, which have opened tip new horizons for an international legal order, the structure of whirs > as since its establishment resisted the onslaughts on the circumstances of life of peoples, is pleased to extend to the president of the general assembly, mr  abdelaziz bouteflika, our most cordial good wishes on his election, through the unanimous will of the countries represented here, to allow him to preside over this session and to guide us with his wellknown experience and wisdom in the tasks which await us we know very well that, as well as having eminent qualifications, he is a patriot determined to bring about the progress of algeria so as to maintain in the forefront the prestige which it enjoys as a country which loves peace and independence, which has outstanding virtues and is concerned to see that the ideals and principles of the charter will also contribute to the rule of peace and brotherhood among all peoples  thus, our delegation is aware that your enlightened mind will assist us to find during this session the most correct solutions to the problems that we shall be dealing with under our agenda, and thus to fulfill the objectives laid down in san francisco when the united nations came into being mr  president, we are certain that you too represent the continuity of that humanistic and universalist philosophy which has been represented here so brilliantly by mr  leopoldo benites, an illustrious son of ecuador, a man whose impact is already continental and universal in the course of the year that has elapsed between the twentyeighth and twentyninth sessions of the general assembly, there have been negative international events which we have had to deplore and which have had repercussions on our organization, the guiding genius in which the peoples that created it entrusted their major objectives for peace and universal solidarity yet it is those very events which put to the test the principles of the charter and the complicated mechanisms available for the attainment of the fundamental objectives  for that reason we must recognize that we must also be convinced that there have been positive events on which the task of the united nations is nourished we must have the hope that the sanctity of nature which is approaching is the foundation of a new beginning, of a new history  our motto from now on should be: we shall all work  nothing could give us more encouragement than these wise words of the immortal north american poet walt whitman: if you don't find me at once, don't be discouraged; if i am not there, look for me elsewhere  i am waiting for you  somewhere i am waiting for you all our peoples are convinced that since the state came into being as a legal concept propelled by the history of civilization up to the present time and since the beginnings of the concept of law, which in america goes back to the sunday before christmas in when in santo domingo the dominican antonio de montesinos delivered a sermon in a church with a cane roof', a revolutionary sermon which he himself called a voice crying out in the wilderness and which the immortal dominican humanist pedro henriquez urena later called one of the great events of our spiritual history, these concepts have constituted the most astonishing invention which the mind of man could have created to ensure the survival of the human species despite all the destructive forces which very often have threatened to eradicate the little world we live in the certainty that we gain from these facts which history and philosophy teach us should be for us and for all the peoples represented in this organization the supreme factor which encourages us even more to become stronger, to recognize that, while it is true that very often some events have aroused inevitable and convenient criticism and others have been viewed as signs of a weakening in the attainment of our fundamental objectives, it is no less true that in every case the principles have become stronger no one can deny that in this century of the atom the horror of war could lead to the destruction of the planet  our organization, far from remaining static although some of its principles have been violated in circumstances which have led some to believe in a crisis of the law has proved, as has been said, that: development of relations among states in the world of today could not be conceived of without a universal organization of the scope of the united nations  if the united nations did not exist, we would have to invent it because of changes in political thinking in a period in history in which our civilization is going through a transition which was already forecast by perhaps unexpected developments and which will change the face of the world, in past years we have expressed similar concepts in response to the quest for constructive solutions; among these we might mention the system of international security and defense the fact that we are witnessing quick changes in ideas which require profound revisions in the systems of law among states, and accordingly in the charter, has been recognized lately, with great vigor and decisiveness, in the latin american region hence, the organization of american states [oas] in carrying out indepth studies which have led to drafts for fundamental reforms of the constituent instrument, which will be submitted to the fifth general assembly to be held in april and to be preceded by the consultative meeting of ministers of foreign affairs, to be held in quito next november  that must be the point of departure for the revitalization and reorganization of the oas, so that it may continue to serve as an effective instrument for the aspirations to peace, development and integration of the peoples of our continent  this means that in this forum too we have felt the vigorous onslaught of changes in structure which, although they have been correct and effective for a long time, have now been powerfully affected by the new facts of the international procedures, thus confirming the postulate that principles are nothing more than an emanation of necessity  the latin american region can be proud at this time that it is testing with useful results at least so far an effective instrument which inevitably will be called upon to be more general in international relations  i am referring to the new dialog we would like to refer logically to the dialog that started in bogota within the broadest framework of brotherhood and equality where, with great clarity and sincere frankness , the ministers for foreign affairs of latin america decided to hold talks with the secretary of state of the united states of america, mr  henry kissinger, so as to seek by joint agreement all latin america united, together with the united states the solution of the most immediate problems of the countries south of the river bravo  this new dialog was continued in tlatelolco, in the beautiful capital of mexico, and later in washington we can point with satisfaction to the spirit of tlatelolco, as we have called this new dawn of a meeting of minds among latin american countries, without claiming to lay down standards for other regions of the world, since other problems, such as those which affect other areas in europe and asia, may find in a similar policy legal, practical and honorable solutions such as permanent peace in the middle east and a solution of the cyprus case, to mention only two striking examples with regard to the third world, it is no bold statement to affirm that one of the causes which regrettably affect respect for human rights, without involving in it the blind crudity of political passions, is forceful measures and the great dissatisfactions aroused by the underdevelopment of peoples, and this is cruder and rougher when it reflects unemployment and poverty which bring about a confrontation between the scant resources available to satisfy these needs and the impossibility of making those resources sufficient thus we cannot fail to support, as we have supported in the past, in this general assembly the need which cannot be postponed to give priority to the claims of the countries of the third world  even though it cannot be denied that progress has been made in that direction, we must frankly admit that in fact there exists no effective dynamic action for a frontal approach to the problem created by underdevelopment in more than areas of the world in so far as the jurisdiction of the united nations extends  we therefore advocate the application in this field of the postulate whereby the developed countries of the world have contracted a natural obligation to contribute so that the countries of the third world may more speedily attain development that is the policy drawn by the charter of algiers, where the matter was considered in its full, tragic consequences with the recognition, therefore, that it is an undeniable truth that the world of today gyrates around the economy, which is the axis which centralizes all constructive forces, on which depend the inevitable and changing social developments of peoples, which are so personally linked to the economic developments* that there is not a single activity of social gathering or of man himself, individually, which does not depend on the economic tides which show the alternatives to our present civilization with regard to international progress, on the other hand, there are perspectives within the present international situation which lead to the recognition that there is a substantial advance towards progressively normalizing situations which have been of concern to states and peoples and which have prevented agreements which would facilitate and reduce to a minimum the causes that bring about a departure from the line of conduct drawn for permanent peace by the united nations, within its legal order for all peoples it is encouraging to contemplate that some obstacles that had seemed to be insuperable have been removed from the road so as to bring about the essential reconciliation required by the concept of universality, which should govern an organization such as ours which already has welcomed more than sovereign and independent states and will receive into the world family more states in compliance with the principles of the selfdetermination of peoples and the total decolonization of the world, an event in relation to which all peoples can legitimately consider themselves to be brothers because of the effectiveness which we attach to dialog, in an atmosphere of friendship and equality and constructive frankness, as a method which should be attempted more frequently in the new diplomacy, we have removed certain clouds which shadowed the prospect of a better understanding between the united states of america and the soviet union, as well as with the people republic of china we do not believe that it is going too far to affirm that this has been the result of the fact that confrontation has been followed by a new and sound criterion of negotiation following the best course for men and nations, so that sooner or later all the rough edges which bar the way to international harmony may be made smooth concerning the law of the sea, two years ago our country had the privilege to be the host for the specialized conference of the caribbean countries on problems of the sea  as the result of the deliberations of that important gathering, which was attended by all the ministers for foreign affairs of all the countries of central america and the caribbean, a new instrument was drafted, called the declaration of santo domingo 7the agenda covered many important aspects on that subject, among which we considered the territorial sea and the exploitation and conservation of marine species, as well as the regime for the seabed, within our joint geographical circumscription, and we also dealt with concrete aspects of pollution as the merciless enemy of marine fertility on that memorable occasion, the idea of the patrimonial sea was stated, the idea of exclusive exploitation not to extend more than miles starting from the base lines the results obtained were undeniably positive in effect, and they have had fruitful repercussions at the second session of the third united nations conference on the law of the sea, held at caracas in  on the fascinating subject of the wealth of the sea and its subsoil as a promising way out for the problem raised by shortages of food and of overpopulation, the projections of which are alarming everywhere in the world it was a fortunate coincidence that the specialized conference, held in santo domingo in  on the territorial sea, the continental shelf and exploitation of the wealth of the sea and related matters, suggested as a conflictive contribution the concept of exploitation, which was an advance over the doctrinaire formulations regarding horizontally and vertically as modules within which the rights of thecoastal countries adopted in in the geneva conventions should be regulated the dominican republic therefore has for decades been cooperating for the development and adoption of a new legal regime for the sea  it was with these convictions that we were present at caracas, and while the conference there did not arrive at a draft convention on this important subject, which involves the interests of all countries equally, it is no less true that it will make it possible to arrive at final formulations on the points on which no agreement was reached at caracas, particularly in respect of the criterion of the dominican republic that major industrial installations on narrow straits must be the subject of negotiations so as to contribute to the prevention of any kind of pollution concerning new states, when we consider the perspective offered by the continuous growth of the united nations, we must rejoice at the fact that the prophecy that we would arrive at the universality desired by its founders, made when it took its first steps in an uncertain world, has been fulfilled we also recognize that this decision on the part of the new states to become members of the organization shortly after achieving independence is an unequivocal sign that the organization is moving forward and that its instruments are effective for the attainment of its objectives, despite changes which occur internally in states and internationally with these convictions, our delegation is pleased and honored to welcome bangladesh, guinea bissau and grenada  we are certain that, as they were able to win independence, so they will be able to share the common responsibilities of all states members of the united nations i turn now to panama  it is of great benefit to america that, after the meetings of the security council held in the city of panama, where all the latin american countries supported the position of panama in its claims for a revision of the canal treaty, and after the visit and the dialog with mr  henry kissinger, negotiations have been started in a spirit of friendship, mutual equality and respect  this is a step forward towards the changes proclaimed in the last international meetings in the latin american region  america has started what we have called the new dialog, which we are taking advantage of only to implement, through a practical, coherent and harmonious system and in accordance with the most deeply felt needs, of latin america, the plans and projects which we need to face the reality of our own situations  to speak now of a policy for accelerated economic development: at this very hour the countries i of the world are meeting in the highest of the inter' national forums and come here loaded with beautiful illusions and with a series of beautiful formulas backed by arguments which are profoundly convincing but often difficult to translate into reality, and require that at this time we frankly and honestly put a stop to the uncontrolled outpouring of projects, plans and programs, many of which have failed to provide the expected results we are going to make a sincere suggestion to the countries that are gathered here, particularly to the countries of latin america  basically we suggest that we should seek a mechanism or the mechanisms necessary for the true, ultimate development of our peoples in these times much is said about the population explosion, which has given rise to great discussions and important meetings, such as the world population conference held at bucharest from to august  fao met in panama not long ago to speak about the need to increase agricultural production  in yugoslavia, from to of this month, the second roundtable was held on agroindustry  much is said of the need to obtain investments for the principal industries and, above all, much is said about the energy crisis and about inflation as one of the problems which have absorbed all mankind in recent times we cannot deny that the apparently disproportionate rise in prices brought about by the petroleumproducing countries lies at the root of the disconcerting runaway inflation which shakes to its very foundations the culture of superconsumption and the relative prosperity maintained up to now  the drama of the situation is clear when we compare the prices of some commodities: a metric ton of corn in cost $ in january it rose to $ the price of wheat which, in large measure, is a world food staple, rose from $per metric ton in to $in january  rice, which is one of the products of highest consumption in the underdeveloped countries, rose alarmingly from $per metric ton in january to $in january of this year the ominous consequences of this dramatic economic process have had the most catastrophic and desperate impact on the poorest countries, where hunger and malnutrition have killed millions and millions of human beings and will do vast harm to future generations, since the infant mortality rate of the poor countries attained its highest point during the year  which surely history will baptize the year of malnutrition and human wretchedness despite these tacts, we realize that the process seems to be irreversible  that is why we are convinced, and we wish to make this known to this assembly, that the means of solving our problems is the rational and intensive exploitation of our soil and at the same time the industrialization of its products, our goal being to attain maximum productivity this policy will of necessity lead us to use the most modern agricultural tools and equipment and the most advanced technical methods in the administration of production, industrialization and marketing programs for agrarian products and, together with agrarian reform, would complement the integral development of latin america it is necessary to incorporate into our development plans the concept of agroindustry, which calls for industries to be established where; agriculture is being practiced, so as to bring to our agricultural peoples not only the possibility of taking part in enterprises which would ensure them a fixed income, social security, bonuses, oldage pensions, and so on, but also an opportunity to educate their children, to change their habits and to raise their standard of living, which bears no comparison with the standard of living of the urban workers, who enjoy high salaries and relative equality of opportunity this policy is different from the policy of import substitution, which leads to an industry without a capacity for innovation and is always underdeveloped  it obliges economic integration to start with microeconomic units forming part of a harmonious scheme, until they can be molded into a single body able to generate the necessary energy to satisfy every need with the greatest possible social justice  it would furthermore be a rational method of halting the great migration of people from the rural areas to the urban centers, attracted by the illusion of a nonexistent industrial development it has been said that an integrated agroindustry is a modern enterprise aiming to industrialize one of the most ancient and most important activities of mankind  hence it is not new; it is the clear and objective definition of its goals that is new, as is also the certainty that it constitutes an effective and fundamental mechanism for a genuine solution to our problems the world is today facing one of the gravest crises ever recorded in the history of mankind, and that is the disproportion between food production and world population growth  there are even large areas of the world where agricultural production has decreased substantially in the past years the essential reason for this almost general deficit in agricultural production is  fundamentally based on the lack of a clear policy which would motivate man and lead him to work his soil in the social conditions required by the world today, such as the technology, the training and administration, the financing and marketing, so that the optimum yieldmay be obtained from the soil it is no accident that cane sugar was, has been and will continue to be one of the main substances of the economic process of the dominican republic, and that the manner in which it is sown, harvested and processed is industrial, with a high degree of technology this is one of the spheres where man has been able to produce raw materials at the lowest prices  cane sugar and its industrial processing constitute a powerful agroindustry in many of our countries, which allow for effective agricultural and industrial yields for the economies of our people the man in the field must have in his hands the necessary means to extract the highest yields from nature  nature, which is wise, has always had its own mechanisms, and since the very beginning of mankind there have always been, although not in the dramatic proportions of today, population growth and production deficit  and today all that we men have achieved has been to create some of the necessary elements for a precarious subsistence for the vast majority of our peoples that is why we make an appeal from this international forum so that all countries, and in particular the latin american countries, may consider the adoption of this policy, since latin america is the area of the greatest hope of the world  it is the area of the world which is least exploited, where the land has not yet been worked technically, where the man in the field constitutes per cent of our population of million inhabitants today, and it is the region that could become one of the most productive areas of the world regrettably, so far most economic policies in our area have been circumscribed to the mere subsistence of the individual  few times and in few countries has any thought been given to or action taken of heroic proportions to face our ills we are totally convinced of the effectiveness of the system of agrarian reform, because in our country, which has a territory of barely square kilometers, in the last eight years, under the administration of the constitutional government of mr  joaquin balaguer, thousands and thousands of families have achieved a substantial increase in their agricultural production  but if we were to create the concept of the manager of the field and make of it a reality, a manager and man from the city in the field, possibly the social mutation that would occur in our countries would have highly positive repercussions for future generations, because if the man of the city were to go to the field and set himself up with a large enterprise, in a constitutionally legal manner, as was done in the dominican republic, the land would become the property of the one who cultivated it, with laws for minimum salary, social security benefits and other kinds of benefits for workers in the field, like the treatment accorded workers in the city; then migrations towards urban centers would be reduced and small countries, such as mine, for example, could relatively easily become societies where all the men who work in the field, would have electricity, television sets, refrigerators and all the advances of modern times, together with fresh air and the beauty of nature obviously the state must provide these managers with the necessary resources, such as the required infrastructure, so that the execution of these projects follows standards of productivity, with a minimum of expenditures, as incentives for the development of managerial skills of this kind it is also vital for international institutions such as the world bank and the interamerican development bank to intensify their actions so that this type of undertaking may serve the purposes sought two decades ago the world had an eminently political criterion  today the criterion is eminently economic  the most obvious proof is how world policy has changed because of the surprising rise in oil prices and the under development of such countries as brazil and venezuela, which have now attained some of the highest production levels and some of the highest standards of living ever recorded in their history by those great and powerful south american nations most of the countries of latin america have suffered a great ill, and there is no more important forum than the general assembly of the united nations for us to carry out our own selfcriticism  and this great ill is the legendary tendency to live by asking for help from the powerful, at a risk of undermining the selfdetermination of our people, to find ways for the powerful to help us, while we maintain an attitude almost of indifference, and not just of collective irresponsibility, expecting others to do things for us, instead of facing our problems with our own intelligence, our own resources and our own means the world of today and absolutely no one disputes thisis made up of a series of independent states with interdependent economies  it is now clear that all the key economic factors must be assessed, both in relation to their national repercussions as well as their international repercussions  it is only in our times that the world leaders seem to have become fully aware of the importance of what has been called economic interdependence  as an expert on economics at harvard university, professor raymond bermond, said: suddenly sovereign states feel naked  concepts of national sovereignty and a national economic potential seem to be curiously lacking in meaning we wish to emphasize that perhaps the most curious aspect of this new development of interdependence is that the reactions that have been aroused have followed no foreseeable standard  few developed or developing countries seem to know how to deal with this  some consider this as coercion and others consider it as an opportunity  but there is complete agreement only in assuring that interdependence is a fact and that it would seem that in certain circumstances it may represent an unprecedented opportunity for development and prosperity however, we cannot ignore the fact that, unless we achieve genuine and integral development in our peoples, interdependence will come to an end, and we shall go back to the humiliating and anachronistic dependence which violates the most elementary 'principles of the integrity of our state to strengthen this thesis and so that we may be conscious of the fact that all that we have stated here is absolutely feasible, we need do no more than read articles  and part of of the charter of the organization of american states, as amended by the protocol of buenos aires, of february which state the following:article  the member states, inspired by the principles of interamerican solidarity and cooperation, pledge themselves to a united effort to ensure social justice in the hemisphere and dynamic and balanced economic development for their peoples, as conditions essential to peace and security article  the member states pledge themselves to mobilize their own national human and material resources through suitable programs, and recognize the importance of operating within an efficient domestic structure, as fundamental conditions for their economic and social progress and for assuring effective interamerican cooperation article  to accelerate their economic and social development, in accordance with their own methods and procedures and within the framework of the democratic principles and the institutions of the interamerican system, the memberstates agree to dedicate every effort to achieve the following basic goals:(a) substantial and selfsustained increase in the per capita national product;(b) equitable distribution of national income;(c) adequate and equitable systems of taxation;(d) modernization of rural life and reforms leading to equitable and efficient land tenure systems, increased agricultural productivity, expanded use of undeveloped land, diversification of production; and improved processing and marketing systems for agricultural products; and the strengthening and expansion of facilities to attain these ends;(e) accelerated and diversified industrialization, especially of capital and intermediate goods;(f) stability in the domestic price levels, compatible with sustained economic development and the attainment of social justice;(g) fair wages, employment opportunities, and acceptable working conditions for all;we are aware that the analysis that we have thought agroindustry deserves does not require so much attention by the countries which, benefiting from the wealth of the subsoil, have been able to make up for some of the poverty with other structures where an extraction industry mobilizes large amounts of capital and thereby have obtained an accelerated course towards development and selfsufficiency if we, the peoples of america, are to achieve and bring to a happy conclusion and concrete reality the programs for agricultural development and industrialization, we shall all of us see our efforts crowned with glory and the efforts of those illustrious statesmen who, with their brave deeds and their glories and the courage of their peoples and the firmness with which they have brandished their swords, gave us our freedom and thereby the right to go on promising and attaining the establishment of a just society where slavery will never exist, nor servility nor dependence on behalf of my delegation, permit me to pay a tribute to peace, which is the supreme objective of the united nations, on the mqittient of whose principles the destiny of mankind depends more than ever today  peace is all the more hidden when we most seek it  it most hides when it is best loved  it is most confused when it is nearest  it is most sacred when it is distant  it is most radiant when it is denied the great geniuses of political thinking of antiquity and of modern times have tried to define peace within its philosophical vastness  let me here, however, simply state the theological thinking of st  augustine, who said:the peace of men is orderly concord; peace at home is agreed uniformity among those in authority and those who obey and live in it; peace in the city is the orderly concord of citizens and neighbors in ruling and obeying; peace in all things is tranquility in order, and order is nothing more than a disposition of equal and unequal things, which gives to each its proper place   may i first of all on behalf of thedominican republic and on behalf of its constitutionalpresident, mr  joaquín balaguer, express our sincerestcongratulations to the president of the fiftieth session ofthe general assembly secondly, i wish to express our profound gratitudeto the minister for foreign affairs of the republic ofcôte d’ivoire, his excellency mr  amara essy, whopresided over the fortyninth session and, particularly, tothe secretarygeneral, who, by his extraordinary effortsand tireless dedication in a world marked by challengesand breaches of the peace, wages a daily combat for thefull implementation of the purposes and principles of theunited nations charter the dominican republic can affirm with pride onthis fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the unitednations its role as a founding member of the unitednations, which signed the san francisco charter withinthe international order that rose from the ashes of thesecond world war, whose fiftieth anniversary we alsocommemorate, and as a country that defends the principleof sovereignty as the inalienable right of the people fifty years after the creation of the united nationsin  the world is in a state of transition toward whathas been termed a new world order, moving frombipolarity to unipolarity in a multipolar world, followingupon the world built in yalta and in the bretton woodsagreements the order was based on a balance of powerand on the united nations as a reflection of the realdesire to seek security and universal peace — and theorganization has managed, since its creation, to avertanother nuclear holocaust general assembly d plenary meetingfiftieth session october small countries such as the dominican republic,staunch guardians of their national sovereignty, havewitnessed during the five decades since this ordercreated through the united nations and its specializedagencies, with bretton woods, the north atlantic treatyorganization (nato), the council for economic aid(comecon), the warsaw pact, and the europeaneconomic community — today the european union; theevolution of countries with market economies and thosewith centrally planned economies, and the decolonizationprocesses which have resulted in the establishment of manyindependent states  all this has left an indelible imprint onthe annals of contemporary history and has been rich inlessons for all the nations of the world — lessons, in aword, on relations between north and south the order which emerged from bretton woods wasreflected in the international monetary fund (imf); theinternational bank for reconstruction and development(ibrd); and the aborted international trade organizationof  which was replaced by the general agreement ontariffs and trade (gatt), from which the agriculturalsector, services and intellectual property were excluded  allthis explains why years later, with the uruguay roundof multilateral trade negotiations and the birth, in  ofthe world trade organization (wto), we are givingmultilateral shape to world trade in order to overcomebilateral barriers and, above all, the protectionism that waspractised by the industrial countries in these five decades, the small countries had tostruggle mightily to uphold the principles of democracy,including respect for human rights, and to defend their rightto access to the markets of the industrialized countriesagainst tariff and nontariff barriers, quotas, and downwardspiralling in the prices of their raw materials  we can,however, point with pride to the way we fought for ourdemands for greater symmetry and fairness in commercialand economic relations  this in the end led to theestablishment of the united nations conference on tradeand development (unctad) the san francisco charter illuminated like apowerful beacon the road to the future of the countries thathad had to experience the difficult period of the bipolarworld  for its part, the dominican republic, committed asalways to the principles of the charter, was able to attainthe functional democracy we enjoy today  this took placewithin a world that has some integration processes andhas seen the emergence of three strong economicintegration blocs with their spheres of influence — such asthe european union and the north american free tradeagreement (nafta) — in addition to the free tradezone of the americas, which will probably be establishedin the year  and, for eastern asia, the asiapacificeconomic cooperation council (apec)  there are alsothe political repercussions these processes have had on aworld where the dreams for centrally planned economieshave faded  our country is now a member of the recentlyestablished association of caribbean states (acs) this new world order that has now become theglobal village foreseen by marshall mcluhan, within aglobalized, international economy, will not be withouttensions, for we do not yet fully grasp the culturalplurality of nations and the strong search for identity inregions and within ethnic and religious groups  contraryto the popular phrase, history has not come to an end  anew process is beginning with the expression by peoplesand regions of their national identity the globalization of trade would seem to transcendthe borders of the nationstate and create a concept of aregionstate, given the fragmentation of nationalaggregate assets within the family of nations we feel proud to havebeen not only one of the states that participated in thesan francisco conference, but also one of the first tohave ratified, in resolution of our national congress,the charter of the united nations, which was promulgatedby our executive branch on august on the fiftieth anniversary of that memorable datewe wish to pay tribute to those members of thedominican delegation who signed that historic document:manuel peña batlle, emilio garcía godoy, gilbertosánchez lustrino, tulio franco y franco and minervabernardino  we are a nation deeply committed to theproper functioning of democratic institutions, havingattained a commendable political stability in ourcontinent’s community of nations in this context, the united nations will be making apraiseworthy contribution to the process of maintainingstability in our country by responding to the request ofthe dominican republic for reimbursement of the fundsspent in implementing the economic embargo imposed onour neighbour, haiti  the dominican republic hassubmitted that request to the secretariat and ourgovernment is now awaiting a response as a developing country the dominican republicmust face many challenges in the sensitive areas of druggeneral assembly d plenary meetingfiftieth session october trafficking and drug consumption  this is a problem ourcountry has met with a state policy that provides for severepunishments for offences related to this crime againsthumanity  at the present time legislation is pending in ournational congress to punish moneylaundering, which is anactivity related to the criminal drug traffic  we are alsocoordinating our policies with the international community,since in this field more than any other internationalcooperation is required it is fitting here to congratulate the united nationssecretariat on the successful holding of the fourth worldconference on women at beijing  that conferencerepresents a milestone in the organization’s history becauseof the recognition it has granted to that noble human beingwho makes up half of all humanity and is the mother of theother half in that connection we would reiterate at this fiftiethsession, just as we did at the last session, our concern at thesecretarygeneral’s proposal to merge the internationalresearch and training institute for the advancement ofwomen (instraw) with the united nations developmentfund for women (unifem)  the general assemblyshould recall economic and social council resolutionof may  which established the permanentheadquarters of the institute in the dominican republic we wish to reiterate — with the utmost courtesy, butalso with the utmost firmness — our request thatinstraw and unifem not be merged, maintaining thecommitments contained in general assembly resolutionof december and the agreement thatestablished instraw in santo domingo so that our firstcity of america may remain the headquarters of thatimportant institute  this would also be in keeping with theextraordinary importance of the recently concludedconference on women we are now only six years from the beginning of thetwentyfirst century, in the year  and our thoughts turnto an assessment of the past years since the founding ofthe united nations  we should also be visualizing thefoundations and the shape of the new world order for thebuilding of a future based on security and world peace this will require a qualitative change in the united nations,removing the sacrosanct aura surrounding the veto power ofthe great powers in the security council and promoting ademocratic system of coexistence among states andpeoples the united nations and we, its member states, willhave to meet the challenge of the demographic or socalled population bomb with growth estimated at million persons per year, and related problems, such asthe fact that in only per cent of the world’spopulation lived in rural sectors and over per cent inurban centres of over inhabitants  the number ofpersons suffering malnutrition is estimated to reach million by the end of the century  children withoutschooling will number million, and there will be million illiterate persons  those living without sanitationsystems will reach million  dealing with thoseproblems will be a real challenge the new context of the world order will require athreepronged approach involving an ecological response,a political response and an economic response although the united nations environmentprogramme was an important step forward for theprotection of the biosphere, consideration should be giventhe possibility of creating, after proper study, anecological response embodied in a united nationsenvironmental security council composed of memberstates with a permanent member executive committeeand a secretarygeneral with executive powers the political response would come from the reformof the united nations charter  in this connection, weshould bear in mind that article of the charter,which was written in  provides for the convening ofa general conference within a year period for thepurpose of reviewing the charter  in addition, on aprila number of former heads of state and politicalleaders appealed for a renewal of the united nations today, it is appropriate to envisage the inclusion ofgermany, japan and india as members of the securitycouncil, as well as the inclusion of representatives ofthirdworld countries charter reform would, of course, imply the exerciseof the powers of the secretarygeneral supported byundersecretaries for environmental, political andeconomic affairs in addition, the economic response should comefrom a clear and precise definition of the role of theunited nations within the new order  since, in theeconomic sphere, the group of has already beencoordinating its policies through a kind of securitycouncil, with the recent addition of russia, we mightenvisage its incorporation into the united nations as ageneral assembly d plenary meetingfiftieth session october sort of economic council that might include, in addition,the countries of southern asia and the pacific, as well aslatin america and other regions  it could eventuallybecome a group of  linked to the general assembly, theeconomic and social council, the specialized agencies andthe regional commissions the dominican republic hopes that the ideas andsuggestions that have been put forward, many now understudy and being proposed in various forums, will be viewedas a goodwill contribution by a small nation — a nationthat is small but proud of its participation in theinternational community for that reason, we cannot, as a small nation thatbelieves in unity within diversity, fail to mention oursupport for the agenda item — proposed by burkina faso,costa rica, dominica, grenada, guatemala, guineabissau, the solomon islands, nicaragua, niger, panama,the central american republic, saint lucia, saintvincent and the grenadines, swaziland and our country,the dominican republic — regarding the special situationof the republic of china in taiwan in the internationalcontext, based on the principle of universality and inaccordance with the established model of parallelrepresentation of divided countries in the united nations the republic of china on taiwan, a foundingmember of the united nations, has a population ofmillion, a high level of economic development and fullpolitical democracy  it has been a model to all developingnations  its aspiration to participate in the united nationsonce again is something positive for the internationalcommunity  the organization must not ignore itsexistence  the dominican republic supports theestablishment of an ad hoc committee to seek asatisfactory resolution of this matter at this fiftieth session, the general assembly shouldtake stock of the achievements of the united nations inits years of existence as well as of the unfulfilledobjectives in the area of the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  but above all it should adopt a visionof the future that will enable us to build a democraticsystem of coexistence among states and peoples, inspiredby the profound human aspiration to lasting peace  maymerciful god help us attain these goals   at the close of the seventh session of the general assembly, all the peoples devoted to international order, freedom and prosperity felt a deep satisfaction based on the heartfelt hope that, with the signing of the armistice at panmunjom and the tangible results achieved there, there had been ensured not only, the final cessation of hostilities in the martyred land of korea but also the initiation and success of negotiations that would lead to the speedy restoration of peace in that country, which had suffered premeditated aggression at the hands of governments whose goal was world domination by violence and hatred, in full accordance with the baneful purposes of international communism for the vast majority of the member states of the international community, and especially for the small countries like the dominican republic, the success of the action undertaken and sustained by the initiative and under the auspices of the united nations in defence of right and justice has shown, at the cost of' indescribable suffering and sacrifice, the urgent need for organizing and putting into effect a powerful system of defence of the international community, based on the requirements of collective security if it is possible to single out, among the essential purposes of the united nations charter, one that can be considered as most important, it is that which requires that the moral force of justice should be constantly strengthened by the categorical and effective warning that the days when might was right have gone forever  thus the united nations is based on the outright condemnation of aggression and violence, and on due submission to the principles and rules under which the life of the international community is organized and developed  the charter is, in short, the triumphant proclamation of the values of the spirit as against the schemings of force and materialism which bring in their train destruction, poverty, suffering and death it is, then, in no way surprising that the whole of that memorable international instrument, the charter signed at san francisco, which was destined to mark the birth of an era of security, wellbeing and dignity for individuals and for nations, is plainly based on the paramount principle of good faith which must govern human relations in all their aspects and which, as was taught by a jurist of ancient rome, imperiously reminds us of our essential obligation, based on law, to keep our word and our promises unfortunately, certain governments, dominated by the communist ideology, do not respect the purposes and principles of the charter as they should, and this has frequently led them to resort to subversion, violence and aggression as means of realizing their expansionist designs and their desire for the domination of peoples and states the case of korea is but one more cruel example added to the painful series with which we are all familiar  those guilty of that unjustifiable aggression have been unmistakably identified by the appropriate organs of the united nations and by international public opinion  the case has been irrevocably judged ever unwavering in its pursuit of justice and peace, the general assembly, in its resolution [(vii)] of august  fully in accordance with the armistice agreement, made specific recommendations concerning the convening of the political conference on korea  never have the determination to restore violated rights and the noblest feelings of humanity and practical wisdom been so intimately and constantly associated as in the work of the united nations now that aggression has been repelled as a result of the united nations memorable initiative and of the military action undertaken and victoriously carried out under its auspices, the united nations sole object in this sad affair is the unification and rehabilitation of korea; that country must be assured a free, democratic and prosperous existence through the restoration of a true and lasting peace the delegation of the dominican republic has expressed its most fervent hope, and expresses it again today, that these aims, which are as noble as they are urgent, may be speedily and fully attained for the good of the korean people and the strengthening of justice and law in the world notwithstanding the eminent wisdom and extreme urgency of the decisions taken at the seventh session of the general assembly, we are already witnessing delaying manoeuvres and unexpected complications plotted behind the scenes, in accordance with familiar communist tactics  that was, beyond doubt, the purpose of the cablegram sent to the secretarygeneral of the united nations on september by the minister for foreign affairs of the people’s republic of china [a/ calling upon the general assembly to undo the results of its long and arduous work at the end of its seventh session and to change the composition of the political conference in accordance with the desires expressed by that government when the delegation of the dominican republic, whilst explicitly and rightly paying tribute to the distinguished position in international life of india, indonesia, pakistan and burma, voted categorically against that attempt, it acted in complete accordance with the view it had previously expressed, namely, that general assembly resolution (vii) of august was completely consistent with the letter and the spirit of the armistice agreement, and that the participation of the soviet union in the political conference, in accordance with the wish of the communist side, was amply justified by the position taken by that country’s government in connexion with the initiation and development of hostilities in korea that was not the sole object, however, of the astonishing cablegram from the minister for foreign affairs of communist china, since it also proposal, contrary to decisions taken by the assembly at its seventh session [h meeting], that an invitation should be extended to the governments of his country and north korea to send representatives to the present session to institute joint negotiations  that demand was tantamount to claiming rewards and honours for aggression and the establishment of identical treatment for the victim and the perpetrators of aggression  happily, the general assembly has already answered those demands with dignity and in appropriate language again in asia, far from korea but in countries bordering on communist china, the governments which planned and put into effect the invasion of the republic of korea have for many years carried on war, with all its attendant horrors  in indochina, france year after year sees thousands of its noblest sons falling side by side with the gallant soldiers of the associated states, on which it has bestowed the precious gifts of its civilization and to which it now promises the establishment of independent national governments  there, too, communism is carrying out its terrible mission of disruption and disorder; thus the vision of the apocalypse advances on the world, bringing nearer the moment when, as the great statesman to whom my people owes its welfare and progress stated some months ago, the united nations will have to take fully into account the heroic effort which the great french nation is still making in defence of the principles on which our civilization rests another of the noble ends to which the free peoples of the world ardently aspire is disarmament, the achievement of which is essential to the very life of mankind  in this vital matter, in view of the practical impossibility of immediately achieving complete disarmament, the general assembly, after full consideration and discussion at previous sessions, decided that, after appropriate control organs had been established and effectively put into operation, steps should be taken towards the limitation and balanced and progressive reduction of all armed forces and all armaments, without exception however, here again, unfortunately, the draft resolution [a/rev  which the ussr delegation recently submitted to the general assembly demands that we should undo the progress so laboriously achieved, which ensured a prudent and effective, if not ideal, solution to this grave question  in this draft resolution, the ussr delegation merely repeats, at any rate in general outline, proposals it has previously submitted and which could not be accepted because their sole object, like the present proposal, was to maintain the advantage of the soviet union in conventional forces and armaments, while eliminating the lead which other powers had gained over the soviet union in weapons of mass destruction the array of grave problems menacing the very existence of mankind increases daily in complexity, bringing the nations steadily closer to a dreadful abyss from whose depths there is no return  it is essential that no time should be lost in the search for acceptable solutions based on wisdom and good faith  in the face of this supreme obligation, mere words and delaying tactics would be a sinister and unimaginable farce that could but lead to suffering and suicide for that reason we fervently hope that the courageous, frank and clear statement made before this assembly, on september [h meeting] by the secretary of state of the united states produce in the minds of the advocates of violence and aggression the good results that ought to proceed from the wisdom, firmness and conciliatory tone of that great statesman’s speech the work for the attainment of the purposes and principles of the charter already accomplished by the united nations justifies this expression of our fervent hope for cooperation and mutual understanding  the results achieved by the united nations are in fact worthy of the highest praise; they have been attained, as any fair review of its work must acknowledge, despite extremely serious compromises which had to be agreed to at san francisco, when the charter was being drawn up, in order to meet urgent political necessities mankind has an immense, permanent debt of gratitude towards the united nations, and it is the duty of the nations devoted to peace and justice to do their utmost to eliminate from the charter provisions which have the effect of paralysing action by the united nations and thus gravely imperil the organization’s strength, vigour and survival the greatest of these dangers to the survival and proper development of the united nations is presented by article  paragraph  of the charter, a completely undemocratic provision which is contrary to the principle of the equality of states before the law, and which the great majority of delegations accepted at san francisco only on the understanding that reasonable use would be made of the veto and that the veto would not be a permanent institution in view of the intolerable abuse of the veto by the soviet union, and in view of the fact that we are approaching the date agreed upon in for a review of the charter, the dominican republic is in fullest sympathy with the proposals submitted by argentina [a/and add  and the netherlands [a/ and will welcome any other proposal that may be put forward with a view to the revision of the charter under article  for my country, it has always been, and will always be, a point of honour faithfully to fulfil the obligations it assumed under the charter; we cannot do otherwise than wholeheartedly associate ourselves with any effort to eliminate from the charter the germs of paralysis and death my government is deeply concerned about the grave problem of prisoners of war captured during the late world war, and especially the position of spanish prisoners detained in soviet territory notwithstanding the cessation of hostilities  because of the dominican people’s particularly close ties with spain, our high humanitarian ideals and our respect for the essential concepts of justice, the dominican republic will raise this important matter at this session in due course it is also a matter of the greatest concern to the government of the dominican republic that spain and italy should be admitted to membership in 'the united nations  spain, the glorious mother of so many american nations, whose fruitful heroism has filled the pages of history, and italy, the cradle of christian civilization and western culture, are both peaceloving countries and play an important part in international life; they therefore have every right to be included, if they so desire, among the states members of the united nations it would be unfitting to conclude this statement without saying once again that the government of the dominican republic has cooperated, and will continue to cooperate enthusiastically and fully, in the various aspects of the allembracing work of the united nations and its specialized agencies the dominican republic, which was the first to raise its voice, at the evian conference in  on behalf of the jewish people, who at that time were being subjected to the vilest persecutions in hitlerite germany, and which granted brotherly asylum to many persecuted refugees, was a member of the international refugee organization until that body was disbanded, and continues to interest itself deeply, and to the fullest possible extent, in the grave problems with which that body was concerned the dominican republic’s work as a member of the trusteeship council and, within the framework of that body, on the committee on italian somaliland in  over which it had the honour to preside, has at all times been marked by a sincere spirit of cooperation and an ardent desire to render the most useful services it can to the international community in these highly important fields in the same way, my country maintains the closest relations with the united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization, am admirable and useful institution with whose valuable assistance extremely interesting seminars on the promotion of literacy were held this year at ciudad trujillo continuing without break the intense progress initiated in with the abandonment of sterile political methods of unhappy memory, the dominican republic has justly won a place for itself in the vanguard of the latin american countries in the movement for economic and social advancement  in all the aspects of social life, which are so important to the purposes and principles of the united nations, my country has reason to be deeply gratified at the level already achieved and the steady progress that is being maintained  we convey our warmest congratulations to the renowned libyan diplomat mr  ali treki on his recent election to preside over the general assembly at this sixtyfourth session, as well as for his call for a dialogue among civilizations, for interreligious understanding, for the promotion for peace and security and for closing the divide between rich and poor   exactly one year ago, when we were taking stock of progress made towards meeting the millennium development goals at the midterm point, something unexpected occurred: the collapse of some of the most emblematic investment banks, and with that the worsening of the global financial crisis    before this crisis occurred, however, the world, in particular the developing countries, was already affected by the impact of two other crises that had begun simultaneously: the crisis involving oil prices and that involving food prices   as a result of the first of these crises, that is, the oil crisis, vigorous and intense social protest broke out in various parts of the world  suddenly, all products became more expensive  governments were forced to use their currency reserves to pay their oil bills and were forced to allocate subsidies for the sake of maintaining civic peace and democratic governance    when it comes to the second crisis, the food crisis, the food and agriculture organization of the united nations established that as a result of the food crisis, the number of people suffering from hunger worldwide rose by million, which meant that for the first time in human history the total figure exceeded the number of billion human beings    before these two crises broke out, the world bank had already indicated that in order to meet the millennium development goals in the remaining seven years — that is, between and — $billion were still needed, or $billion every year  obviously, with the outbreak of these crises, which gravely affected the economies of developing countries, the resources needed to meet the objectives that had been set to cut by half the level of poverty worldwide would have to be increased significantly above the projected figures established by the world bank   as one can see, the situation last year was already bleak at the time of submitting for analysis and evaluation the achievements that had been made and future challenges to meet in order to achieve the millennium development goals  in spite of the dark clouds that were gathering on the global economic horizon, we still felt optimistic; we held the illusion that we might meet our targets  after all, we had made continuous progress towards meeting some of the goals  but from then on, we witnessed the deluge of the global financial crisis  since then, the storm has been so intense that it has created a widespread state of anxiety and fear at a global scale the likes of which has not been seen in many decades    according to the directorgeneral of the world health organization, dr  margaret chan, more children and tens of thousands of women will die every year as a direct consequence of the global financial crisis  today, while the meetings of the general assembly of the most important global organization are being held, children will die in various parts of the world  that is the equivalent of saying that a child will die every three seconds, or children every minute    by the time i conclude my statement this afternoon — my minute statement — worldwide children will have died, whose early deaths could have been avoided  throughout the course of this year, million children, which is equivalent to the entire population of my country, the dominican republic, will have lost their lives for no reason or justification  this represents a human tragedy of epic proportions, a true catastrophe  it is morally and politically unacceptable  for that reason, it is important to call upon the general assembly to declare a state of emergency with regard to compliance with the millennium development goals    when facing the challenges to our efforts to meet the eight goals established in the year for improving the human dignity and living conditions of millions of people worldwide, it is possible to adopt different attitudes  we might consider that we have failed and that these goals can never be met; that they represent a new utopia and therefore the only path    remaining is to abandon any effort to meet those goals  clearly that would be a cowardly and irresponsible attitude — the worst possible decision  it would mean leaving all those in need of human solidarity and compassion out in the cold  a second attitude would be to reconsider the goals and then extend the timetable to fulfil them; that would seem logical and reasonable  however, that reasoning encounters one obstacle — the fact that children, the poor and the women of the world cannot wait   the only real way to ensure fulfilment of the millennium development goals by the planned date, is for the general assembly to work towards promoting true commitment among nations and governmental and nongovernmental institutions to urgently assume their task to achieve economic and social development for all people affected by poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy   it cannot be argued that the resources available to address this urgent task are insufficient  we have seen in the diligent manner used to address the collapse of the international financial system that — as the saying goes — where there is the will there is a way   looking ahead, the first thing to be considered is that with the forecasted end of the global economic recession and the resulting gradual recovery of economic growth, we must ensure that we never again witness such a sudden and abrupt increase in oil and food prices as a result of excessive speculation and the transactions of the futures market  we issue this warning because we have been observing with concern, an increase in milk prices over the past three weeks on the international market that have risen by more than $per ton without any valid justification    we must set aside all individual interests, resistance and obstacles that stand in the way of the reform of the global financial system and the stock markets, in order to establish new mechanisms for regulation and supervision that will guarantee that no crisis such as this one will ever occur again   because of the lack of compliance to date by the majority of developed countries with their commitments made during the copenhagen world summit for social development to contribute to the development of the poorest and most vulnerable nations and due to the prevailing situation of the global recession, we draw the attention of the general assembly to the possibility of finding new sources of financing for the millennium development goals    in that regard, we suggest the creation of a working group to carry out professional, highquality research and submit a report containing recommendations and a plan of action geared towards establishing a fine to benefit development on capital deposited in fiscal havens, offshore banks and international financial centres  placing financial resources in such fiscal havens means that every year we witness tax evasion in a sum equivalent to $billion — a figure — according to the world bank — equal to the total sum of external aid necessary to meet the millennium development goals    according to the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd), some $trillion is currently deposited in tax havens which do not contribute one single cent towards fiscal income  oxfam has indicated that more than $billion in fiscal income slips through the fingers of developing countries each year as a result of offshore banks and tax havens  the organization christian aid has also affirmed bleakly that tax evasion is responsible for the deaths of more than million children between the year and — the years we set to meet the millennium development goals   there are abundant resources in the world and what is happening is that they are unfairly and unequally distributed due, inter alia, to an existing global financial architecture marked by the lack of transparency, secrecy, moneylaundering, evasion and fraud  our only hope of changing the current situation of economic decline and social deterioration and the moral crisis that is shaking up the world lies in adopting brave, wise and timely decisions in this prestigious global forum   the peoples of the world are waiting for these decisions  they are aware that their right to a dignified, honourable and happy life depends upon that  we cannot let them down  we must act with justice courage, a sense of history and with a vision of the future   i cannot conclude this statement without touching upon the current prevailing situation in honduras  the united nations passed a resolution condemning the coup d’état which took place in this central american nation in june of this year and called for the return of democratic order  the same attitude was adopted by the     organization of american states, the european union, the african union and by the league of arab states  despite the entire world’s condemnation of that assault on democracy, the de facto government of honduras has remained in power, thereby underscoring the weaknesses of the international community to take action    president josé manuel zelaya — the sole legitimate president of honduras, who was scheduled as the sixth speaker to take the floor in the general assembly this afternoon — has, in a great display of personal courage and daring, preferred to return to his country  it is now to be hoped that we the representatives of the peoples gathered here at this world forum will be able to act with the same dignity, sense of responsibility and level of commitment when it comes to the supremacy of democracy, freedom and justice  \\ufeffthe dominican republic wasamong the countries that founded the united nations  butthis is only the third time, in years, that its head ofstate has come to address the general assembly  perhapsthe reason for this noticeable absence of our country duringthe many years that this great annual event has been heldis that following the second world war, the internationalsystem revolved around superpower rivalry, giving rise tothe cold war  in context, it is probable that our leaders feltthat their presence here would have been merely symbolic,with no real importance that this may have been the case in the past, but theworld has changed  from the dramatic transformations inthe geopolitical environment, a multipolar internationalsystem has emerged, in which the economy matters morethan ideologies and military conflicts  this reorganizationof the international system on the basis of strategiceconomic objectives has been accompanied by a scientificand technological revolution, a revolution of knowledge thatspread across the planet and brought about the mostprofound change ever experienced in the history ofhumankind, turning the world into one large neighbourhood in the new international order that arose following thecold war, the dominican republic could not remainisolated  that is why we are here today: to proclaim to theworld that the dominican republic is now actively joiningthe group of nations represented in this multilateralorganization, so that, through international contacts andexchange, it can contribute to forging a better future forhumanity and, accordingly, a more promising future fordominicans to ensure our participation in the various forums ofthe united nations forums, exercising all the rights thathave been bestowed upon us, we proceeded, first, to payour financial debts in full  to the dominican republic,the payment of our arrears is evidence of our confidenceand faith in the capability of the united nations to playa role in the international arena to guarantee internationalpeace and security as well as respect for human dignityand fundamental human rights nevertheless, just as we understand that the worldhas changed, that there is a new international agendagoverned by the common concerns of all peoples overenvironment preservation, population growth, respect forhuman rights, strengthening of democratic systems,recognition of women’s rights, and the social andeconomic development of nations, we also understand thatthis organization must be renewed and readapted to thenew world circumstances latin america and africa do not have permanentrepresentatives on the security council, and asia has onlyone  this means that there is uneven representation in thatimportant body, which is incomprehensible in anorganization whose members enjoy equal footing, on theprinciple that they are all sovereign states  it is ourhumble suggestion that the security council should beextended to enable asia, africa and latin america tohave two permanent seats on that body and that thenumber of nonpermanent representatives be increased todemocratize the decisionmaking machinery in that forumfor peace in one of his most frequentlycited works on thecaribbean, entitled el caribe, frontera imperial, theformer dominican president and author, juan bosch,wrote as follows:“the history of the caribbean is the history ofthe struggle of empires against the peoples of theregion in order to rob them of their rich lands  it isalso the history of the struggle of empires againstone another to rob the possessions each one hadconquered  lastly, it is the history of the peoples ofthe caribbean to free themselves from their imperialmasters ”this direct contact with the major powers over thecourse of five centuries, a product of these confrontations,5has marked the caribbean, perhaps forever, with aparticular stamp of fragmented histories, and differentcultures and languages  yet we are always seeking unitywithin diversity recent years have brought greater understanding andcloser bonds between us, based on the understanding thatwe have a common destiny  as proof of this, our countryis a founding member of the association of caribbeanstates (acs), an organization bringing together nations thatare very different both in ethnic terms and in developmentlevels, and thus reflecting the richness and variety of ourregion we would be pleased to see formal contact with andbacking from the united nations for that recently createdbody, in support of the efforts we have made to strengthenour relations and to work for our peoples’ development similarly, we have been participating in the caribbeanforum of african, caribbean and pacific (acp) states,which is made up of caribbean countries that benefit fromthe fourth lomé convention  this forum has carried out aseries of regional projects financed with european unionresources as an observer, and aspiring fullfledged member, ofthe caribbean community and common market(caricom), we view with great interest the widening anddeepening relationship between the united nations andcaricom  we urge that the necessary steps are be takento intensify the cooperation and coordination between thetwo institutions, which would enable us to achieve ourcommon goals the countries of the caribbean are facing thechallenges of current circumstances, as the advantages ofaccess to markets are being eroded because of theimplementation of world trade organization agreements,the effects of a single european market, the consolidationof the north american free trade agreement (nafta)and the movement towards reciprocity and similar trends our participation in preferential access schemesdepends on the observance of established standards withregard to workers’ rights, human rights, intellectualproperty rights, the environment and civil liberty — mattersthat go beyond economic considerations we have gained certain advantages from preferentialtrading with the united states and the european union, asa result of greater prosperity that led to an increase inimport demand from those countries and an increase intourism in the caribbean  by contrast, we must endure thecomplications of the new rules and harmonizationstandards that have come into force  we have not yettaken full advantage of the benefits deriving from suchconcessional agreements as the fourth lomé convention,the generalized system of preferences, and the caribbeanbasin initiative our high dependence on foreign trade, the shortagein the supply of goods and services and unsuitablemarketing methods constitute elements of vulnerabilitythat affect, to a greater or lesser extent, all the countriesof the region  we must overcome these limitations anddefine areas in which we can be competitive strengthening cooperation is one way to support thecaribbean integration process and rectify suchweaknesses when referring to the caribbean, let us not forgetthe situation in haiti, the country with which we share theisland of hispaniola  we view with sympathy the processof democratization that is unfolding in that country, andwe appeal to the international community to do its utmostto assist in the huge task faced by the children of thecountry of toussaint l’ouverture in constructing a betterfuture for their countrymen one of the first foreignpolicy actions of ourgovernment was to encourage a cooperative and friendlyrelationship between the dominican republic and haiti,and we put in place the joint bilateral commission  aftera fruitful meeting, which took place a few day ago inportauprince, that commission agreed to a series oftechnical exchange agreements in the fields of tourism,agriculture, trade and investment, sports and border andimmigration matters  furthermore, we defined theconditions for joint strategies to take advantage of fundsprovided by multinational sources, such as those grantedby the european union under the terms of the fourthlomé convention i would now like to direct the attention of thegeneral assembly to a subject that just a few years agowas on the front pages of all the newspapers of the worldand that, even though it still has a considerable impact onthe effectiveness of development policies, has vanishedfrom the world’s attention: the problem of foreign debt the countries of the region have carried out a series ofadjustment programmes in an attempt to regain externalfinancial solvency  nonetheless, there are stillconsiderable imbalances as a result of the burden of debt6servicing, without a corresponding recovery in the terms ofexchange that would allow us to create greater resourcesthrough our exports in the case of the dominican republic, foreign debtincreased fold between and  today, thanks toour extraordinary efforts, our country is now current withits international creditors, which means that we are eligiblefor further external financing  however, being current withour payments to international credit organizations has meantthat our government has incurred greater social debts to thedominican people  there are fewer resources to invest ineducation, health, housing and social security and,ultimately, to deal with the critical situation of poverty thataffects most of our people in its years of existence, the united nations hasmade extraordinary efforts to eradicate bellicose conflicts indifferent parts of the world and to contribute to themaintenance of peace and international security  but greathuman sacrifice is inherent in the theatre of war, and ourimpoverished neighbourhoods have adopted the names ofwartorn places, symbolizing the extent of their fightagainst misery  in the dominican republic the poor andmarginalized neighbourhoods have adopted such names asviet nam, katanga and cambodia; none of them, of course,is called sweden, japan or germany  this means that thisinternational organization’s new role is to guaranteeinternational peace and security through mechanisms topromote the economic and social development of the lessfortunate nations for this reason, with respect to debt, our countrybelieves that multilateral organizations that providedevelopment assistance and the donor governments,together with the debtors, must find more lasting solutionsto the burden of foreign debt servicing, so that we canrelease resources that can immediately be used to fightpoverty and to stop the deterioration of the environment we have made progress in that regard, and it is fair torecognize that the g the international monetary fund, theworld bank and the regional banks for developmentassistance, such as the interamerican development bank,have consistently designed and implemented importantmechanisms to alleviate the foreigndebt burden, amongwhich the socalled brady plan and the gprogrammesfor the reduction of bilateral debt stand out however, in the near future we will need to reviewsome of the sacred principles prevalent in the internationalfinancial community now for many years, such as thoserelated to the paris club cutoff date and the impossibilityof debt restructuring with multilateral organizations  thisaffects especially the socalled least developed countries,which could receive preferential treatment in this regard the dominican republic therefore urges all interestedparties to move forward to enable the underdevelopedcountries to implement viable programmes against povertyand marginalization, within a financially sustainablecontext in addition to the fight against poverty, at this stageof reforming the international system it is important totake all appropriate measures to fight terrorism and illegaldrug trafficking, scourges that deeply affect the normaldevelopment of mankind  recently, international drugcartels have tried to use caribbean routes to carry outtheir illegal operations  the dominican republic has beentaking all possible measures to prevent the use of itsterritory as a medium for drug trafficking and drug use for dominicans, drug use and trafficking are a nationalsecurity problem, which we will fight with the necessaryforce to eliminate an evil that has become the greatplague of mankind at the end of the twentieth century in expressing its willingness to play a more activerole in the international system, the dominican republicalso expresses its concern at the many unresolvedconflicts in different parts of the world  we advocate adefinitive and peaceful resolution of the conflict in bosniaand herzegovina; of the search for peace in middle eastbetween the government of israel and the palestineliberation organization; of cooperation and assistancewith regard to situations such as those of somalia,burundi and liberia  as to the republic of china ontaiwan, we believe that due to its location in the centreof east asia, its security and stability bear a close relationwith the peace and prosperity of that region, and wetherefore encourage both the sides along the taiwan straitto resume constructive dialogue with a view to achievingmutual cooperation and understanding  we believe thatthe parallel participation of both sides in the unitednations would be conducive to maintaining peace we stand at the threshold of a new century and anew millennium, which will bring new challenges as wellas new opportunities for human progress, and anorganization such as the united nations has alwaysserved to stimulate the noblest of human aspirations  thedominican republic, trusting in god and in the creativecapacity of its people, aspires to be a spokesman and aninstrument for channelling the ideals of justice, peace,7democracy and prosperity, which inspire the civilizednations of the world  mr  president, first of all i wish to convey to you my congratulations on your election in the certainty that your wisdom and your qualities as a statesman and a student of the problems which affect the international political scene are guarantees that the tasks before us will lead to effective results to the satisfaction of all peoples of the world an outstanding thinker of the antilles and foremost sociologist propounded the thesis that the moral progress of peoples runs in the opposite sense to the course of their material progress  that sociological concept applies to the successive periods of the history of civilization in the world of today we are witnessing technological and scientific progress of such dimensions that we could almost say that it has outstripped man fantasy, which has always been governed by his tremendous imagination  thus we have come today to the invention of destructive weapons which could wipe out the human race; and, similarly, with the arrival of man on the moon we can say that we have entered upon the stage of the domination of outer space today, almost everyone concedes that at this juncture in civilization, material progress, spurred by science, has changed the characteristics of a natural process in man that is to say, the structure of the individual and collective mentality it would be difficult to forecast how far nations can be carried by the undeniable, realistic postulate which suggests the existence of an inverse ratio between material progress and moral progress in society today from those considerations we could reach the view, which has been repeated since ancient times, that truly man is his own worst enemy  hence the idea of domination at the cost of destruction and war has still not disappeared the work done by the united nations to achieve peace and eliminate the scourge of war, the events that have occurred and the actions that have been taken from the san francisco conference to the present day to avoid the spreading of wars beyond the areas of conflict leave no doubt about how exposed nations find themselves to ruin and the violence of a third world war, perhaps of nuclear dimensions, which would wipe out any vestiges of a society which was always in ferment but which in the depths of its being cherished a noble vocation for peace  here again, this is a threat that we all view with trepidation, because, despite the years that have passed and the efforts that have been made, we have still not been able to avoid the international tensions which appear to be the major enemy to peace the picture that i have just sketched is, as we know, in no way encouraging, and it should not really be presented here by the delegation of a country small in territory such as ours; rather it should be presented by the great powers, which inevitably govern the destinies of mankind  however, as we are fully aware that all states are equal, and as experience teaches us that ideas are the heritage of all mankind, we are repeating a concern which we know is shared by a large part of mankind we should add to the foregoing considerations that we are convinced that these facts alone are not the only cause of the abnormalities which exist in the international order it is possible that in the world of today there exists a specific causal divisive element which makes possible this imbalance between moral progress and material progress in the world in which we live  we are referring specifically to the crisis in law  thus we see that the more we progress towards the development of legal standards, enshrined in treaties and conventions, the weaker and more ineffective they become in the enforcement of those norms, thus ensuring the necessary maintenance of peace and reasonable coexistence  take, for example, the failure to observe treaties setting forth a lofty humanistic vision of man, specifically in international conflicts, as has occurred in the case of the geneva conventions on prisoners of war, on inherent rights, on smuggling and the illicit traffic in drugs, international delinquency aggravated by the hijacking of aircraft and many other violations of the law from these considerations we conclude that if such things are happening in the international community it would not be at all venturesome to assert that the obstacle which stands in the way of peace and the elimination of international tensions is, as we have already stated, the crisis in law we have recognized that this is not the sole cause of the anguish in which we, the peoples of the world, live, but we cannot deny that such a crisis has a great deal to do with the fact that viable solutions are not being found to the problems whose solutions are the direct responsibility of the states involved in a dispute, as well as of the united nations, which is the repository of the most powerful machinery which we can count upon for the solution of such conflicts it is not incumbent upon us to spell out in terms of doctrine a policy of such magnitude in order to break the vicious circle in which we find ourselves confined  it is certainly up to us, however, to organize, to find a way out of the critical realities with which we are confronted today, and we could discover the way out if there were a meeting of the minds on the necessity to work out a system to restore confidence, without which no permanent peace is possible despite the conviction that this is a difficult task and that many paths will have to be smoothed in order to reach this system of security, to which reference has been made so many times by so many voices in this hall, it is equally certain that specific sacrifices are required which will test the real desire for peace which prevails in the world today one of the methods that my delegation considers would be effective would be the one referred to in resolution (xxvi), which empowers member states to take positions on means of enhancing the effectiveness of the security council in accordance with the principles and provisions of the charter of the united nations  we are convinced that an enhancement of these methods would be a step forward towards the possibility of reaching a point where we could work out the system of security to which we have referred but we must recognize that the desired enhancement of the methods to improve the efficiency of the security council would require a revitalizing of certain fundamental instruments available to the council  accordingly, my government stresses the criterion that the charter should be revised in respect of the provisions on the right of veto we are absolutely certain that it will be impossible to increase the efficiency of the security council just so long as we do not remove from the charter a privilege which is at odds with the very essence of democracy  we say this because, far from being a notable step forward in the features characteristic of our era, which is typified by its revolt against old structures; this privilege is in itself an archaic institution  perhaps it was justified when the victorious powers were laying the foundations of this world organization and wished by the veto to rule out alternatives for international equilibrium however, we would agree that the method should be attenuated in such a way that this exceptional right should be exercised only in circumstances in which we obviously face the alternative of a conflict that could endanger world peace the dominican republic, which has always been known for the support it has given to the predominance of human rights in our organization, is firmly convinced that never before has our civilization been under a greater obligation to make freedom and dignity for man a reality  accordingly we cannot possibly concede that states may infringe or make conditional the respect for and protection of the inherent rights of the human person  it is not difficult to understand that there can be no freedom where these rights are infringed for all of those reasons my country is opposed to acts of violence in all their forms of social upheaval; hence we reject the attacks which, like the one which took place recently in munich, constitute acts of barbarism that are the fruit of the most savage form of terrorism, as our chief of state, h e  joaquin balaguer stated  this is all the more true when by such acts innocent persons who are not involved in the motives that blindly lead people to take up arms and engage in destructive activities become the victims in a period of such tremendous progress, such as that which has been made in the field of human rights, we cannot close our eyes and remain indifferent to the recent tragic events which occurred in the emotiontorn olympic village  for this reason, my government could not fail to give its support to the request for the inclusion in the agenda of item concerning measures to prevent international terrorism and other forms of violence which endanger or take innocent human lives or jeopardize fundamental freedoms, in the conviction that, in addition to energetic protests, there will emerge from this hall the necessary action to put an end to such horrendous acts nor can we fail, on this occasion, to refer to the development process which is under way in the dominican republic today, in accordance with the plans that are being pressed forward by our constitutional government with relentless vigor while it is true that one of the reasons for the state of anxiety in which mankind is living today is a result of the crisis in law, it is equally true that the most effective way to deal with this situation is to obtain balanced development for all of our peoples  hence, the words of his holiness pope paul vi, who said: development is the new name of peace  this message has reached all peoples with great conviction and force accordingly, at this time, my government is deeply involved in the most thoroughgoing revolution' of our structures which was ever recorded in the history of hispaniola, with the introduction and implementation of the agrarian code which sets up the machinery to hand over to the farmer the land that he cultivates and to take from overgreedy hands the principal sources of the wealth of the republic my government hopes that after having doubled the per capita income of our country after barely six years, we will be able in a few years to continue to develop our vast wealth of resources which heretofore has been practically unproductive, so that we can continue strengthening the soundness of our democratic institutions and uproot, once and for all, the causes that have led to such frequent upheavals as are recorded in the history of the dominican republic as another trend within this spirit of progress which pervades the dominican republic, we can point to the importance that my government has attached to the conclusions that are summarized in the declaration of santo domingo [a/ annex i, sect , a basic document of the specialized conference of the caribbean countries on problems of the sea, which was held in santo domingo from to june and which was attended by ministers for foreign affairs of the caribbean region on that occasion our attention was devoted not only to the problem of the exploitation of the resources of the sea, but also towards everything that is required to preserve the species as an inseparable aspect of the fundamental question of exploitation  thus we were also able to contribute to a subject matter which involves the human environment, a matter to which this assembly is to devote special attention  we were trying thereby to take one more step forward in respect of the complicated problem of pollution and development for those reasons it would be most appropriate if we could succeed at this session in persuading the countries represented here to find concrete solutions while we prepare effectively to apply the principles already accepted under existing conventions on the problem of the contamination of the sea, which affects us all, aware as we are that we shall have to find adequate solutions, in view of the interrelationship between pollution and the whole process of the development of nations the importance and the dissimilarity of the items on the agenda of this twentyseventh session of the general assembly explain the interest felt by the foremost leaders of the world in finding day by day solutions more in accordance with the reality in which we live  hence, after objective analysis of the importance of youth today and, above all, noting the fact that more than half the world is less than years of age, the united nations has endorsed this categorical statement: the young generation is a segment of the population whose needs are growing day by day and whose contribution to development is vital as we are all aware of the responsibility that devolves upon us within this organization to exert our efforts to work out national development plans, there is nothing more urgent for the full discharge of this duty than to incorporate youth in the serious tasks of renewal and development  therefore we view with great satisfaction the fact that we are going to discuss the question of youth, its education, its principles, its needs, its active participation in development and international cooperation we have seen with great hope how in this past decade youth has begun to play a decisive role in the inevitable process of transformation of our social, political and economic structures and how efficiently it is carrying out its great responsibilities we can assert that we are witnessing today a phenomenon characteristic of this century and that the time will come when the new generations will have to inherit this world organization, at which time we are sure they will champion the most cherished hopes of past generations the coming generations recognize that the united nations is the repository of the principles and ideals for which they are fighting so dynamically and wisely in order to advance the ideas of the new era  therefore we will advocate a reexamination of policies concerning youth, in each country national plans, so that the organizations of the world system can redouble their efforts towards the creation of new projects that will satisfy their just desires for progress in his encyclical letter populorum progressio his holiness pope paul vi summarized the overriding importance of development in the maintenance of peace and the strengthening of progress when he said:all of you who have heard the appeal of suffering peoples, all of you who are working to answer their cries, you are the apostles of a development which is good and genuine, which is not wealth that is selfcentered and sought for its own sake, but rather an economy which is put at the service of man, the bread which is daily distributed to all, as a source of brotherhood and a sign of providence allow me to conclude my statement this afternoon by adopting for ourselves this other appeal by pope paul vi, contained in the same encyclical:government officials, it is your concern to mobilize your peoples to form a more effective world solidarity, and, above all, to make them accept the necessary taxes on their luxuries and their wasteful expenditures in order to bring about development and to save the peace  delegates to international organizations, it depends on you to see that the dangerous and futile rivalry of powers should give place to collaboration which is friendly, peaceful and free of vested interests, in order to achieve a responsible development of mankind, in which all men will have an opportunity to find their fulfillment  it is an honour to participate once again in the work of the general assembly as a representative of the people and the government of the dominican republic  at the outset, i would like to welcome and congratulate mr  mogens lykketoft on his election as president of the general assembly at its seventieth session this anniversary gives us the opportunity to put in perspective what the organization has meant for humankind  it was established years ago as the fruit of the worst horrors of war and as the first global forum created to preserve peace, coexistence and the well being of all human beings  it is true that the united nations was born of the wounds, pain and fear left by the great conflicts of the twentieth century, but it also arose from the unstoppable force of hope and the iron will of great men and women who believed in dialogue, solidarity and the grandeur of the human race although we still have far to go and although immense challenges remain, the organization continues to represent the values that inspire us day\\x0ca/pv after day  over the past months, the international community has experienced difficult challenges, but it has also witnessed encouraging events that we would do well to recall  we witnessed the reopening of embassies between the united states and cuba, which brings us closer to the day when that sad, decadeslong conflict will finally come to rest in the history books  we are also putting the final touches on a renewed commitment to global development, which is enshrined in the postdevelopment agenda in the form of the agenda for sustainable development (resolution   at the same time, the industrialized nations have finally taken a decisive and resolute step forward to combat climate change  we welcome their political will, for which we have been calling for some time, because we believe it represents an act of responsibility and justice that heralds a more equitable model for the distribution of responsibilities between rich and poor nations the postdevelopment agenda provides an excellent opportunity for us to focus on our most central priority and the greatest enemy of sustainable development, namely, inequality  the fight against inequality is the point of departure for solving the majority of the global challenges, yet it remains our main unfinished task throughout the world, especially in latin america  if we review our achievements, we see a landscape filled with light and shadow, one that offers grounds for rejoicing but also one that prompts urgent calls to action  on the one hand, latin america, after asia, is the region with the largest middle class, with more than million people projected to attain that status by  according to the organization for economic cooperation and development however, along with subsaharan africa, it is also the most unequal region in the world  even today, the wealthiest per cent of latin americans receive per cent of the region’s income, while the poorest per cent receive only per cent  so, despite our efforts to combat poverty, it remains excessive and is aggravated by great inequality  as the excellent study by the economic commission for latin america and the caribbean (eclac), entitled “instability and inequality”, points out, greater equality with growth requires two profound changes — first, in our structure of production, and secondly, in our structure of distribution  in other words, growth is as necessary for equality as equality is for growth  to put it even more clearly, we need both a responsible productive sector thatguarantees wealth creation across all layers of society and an active, effective state to ensure the redistribution of wealth and the creation of opportunities however, if we look at the current structure of the productive mechanisms of the countries of latin america, we have to acknowledge the differences within that structure  in other words, we need to recognize that at least three levels of development exist simultaneously in each country  on our journey towards progress, we not only ride in different cars and in different classes, but on different rails, which means that we move forward at radically different speeds  according to a recent study of countries in latin america and the caribbean that was conducted by eclac and the german agency for international cooperation, our region operates a highspeed rail system, as it were, which connects modern global businesses to international trade and accounts for per cent of gross domestic product but only per cent of jobs; a mediumspeed rail, which prevails in the middle income countries, accounting for per cent of gross domestic product and per cent of jobs; and finally, a rail that serves microbusinesses and the informal economy, which together bring in only per cent of wealth but account for per cent of jobs  that makes it impossible for everyone to benefit and participate proportionally in growth as the eclac study makes clear, what we have is a structural factory for inequality, which means that major changes will be needed to correct our path and enable everyone to advance at the same rate  we need to change the structure of production, shatter the old ways and move ahead together to a model that will benefit everyone, big and small  to begin with, it is essential that the “middle way” be promoted in particular  public policies must help to ensure that small and medium sized enterprises have better access to credit and are more competitive, productive and innovative  small and mediumsized enterprises must also become actors in globalization, finding their proper place in the production chains  in that way they will be able to provide not just more jobs, but proper jobs, highquality jobs, and they will be able to hire an increasingly well trained labour force along with the necessary changes in the structure of our economies, the state should be the second pillar of the fight against inequality  we have to reassert the role of the state as an effective redistributor of wealth, as a creator of opportunities and as a defender of the rights of all citizens \\x0ca/pv let us remember the counterexample of what happened in the , during the socalled lost decade  poverty increased to cover almost half of the latin american population  the austerity policy that many states opted for further aggravated the situation and slowed the recovery  in the next decade, the , the recovery began, and there was major progress in key areas, such as education  that yielded fruit in  when a labour force that was better educated than their parents was finally able to finally benefit from an expanding economy and higher wages since then, the gini index on income inequality has dropped by per cent  that shows clearly that social policies are essential, along with changes in productivity and improvements in the labour market  we cannot continue looking at the relationship between economic policies and social policies as an unresolvable conflict  rather, we have to tackle both aspects at the same time and move in the same direction to reduce inequality  only in that way can we deal with problems that seem to be endemic, but that actually derive in large measure from the disproportionate allocation of available resources look at what has been happening to our youth  today, this generation of young people has received more years of schooling than anybody else in our history  and yet, they have higher rates of unemployment and only parttime work  another paradox is that, although they have more years of schooling, only one third of poor students, according to tests, meet the minimum reading competency levels  in parallel, the increasing automation of work means that soon, instead of choosing between skilled and unskilled jobs, it will be a question of skilled jobs or simply unemployment  therefore, if we do not want that scenario to continue perpetuating exclusion, we have no other option than to make a firm commitment to quality education  and we have to do that in a serious way  the dominican republic is trying to improve the quality of its educational system, and we are also trying to achieve the necessary changes to make our economy grow in equality, so that our state can be active in supporting its people inequality is the root cause of many of the challenges that we face globally, including violence and insecurity, which particularly afflict latin america and the caribbean  ours is the only region where the homicide rate has increased over the past years  there is a lot of discussion about the relationship between violence and inequality  recent studies show that a per centincrease in the gini index leads to a similar rise in the homicide rate  and though it may sound harsh to describe that terrible tragedy in economic terms, we cannot fail to note that the impact of violence on people and goods costs us per cent of the gross domestic product in the latin american region  at the same time, inequality is also a breeding ground for transnational crime and drug trafficking, which are recruiting young people at an increasingly early age and robbing them of future opportunities therefore, one of the tasks facing us at the international level is to rethink our policies on how to combat drugs  as members of the assembly know, next year the special session on the world drug problem will take place, at the request of mexico, guatemala and colombia  we hope that, by the time that session is held, the idea that drugs constitute a problem that affects only some countries will have been dismissed for good  the tens of thousands of people killed in the socalled war on drug trafficking in latin america and the caribbean cannot be regarded as collateral damage  it is a humanitarian disaster that is due too often to policies that have been badly designed and/or are poorly implemented  we need to change our focus and reach a new, more updated and realistic international consensus that leaves room for national governments to design policies suited to their circumstances, as some countries represented here are already doing in conclusion, may i return to the more optimistic note on which i began  the international community, represented here in the general assembly, has made historic progress  although we know that much remains to be done, the balance of what has been achieved in terms of the millennium development goals shows that we can move ahead when we focus our efforts properly  our experience in the dominican republic shows that having a clear agenda and a common course is the only way to move forward rapidly  we have therefore prepared our postdevelopment agenda, which leads us to propose a major partnership between the private sector, civil society and government so that the change can be lasting and sustainable  we believe that when the political will exists, no challenge is too great  i have no doubt that we can find the will to overcome the challenges before us the postagenda provides the opportunity to focus our efforts on the roots of the problems  the time is now  the responsibility is ours  from now on, let us work to create countries with equal opportunities\\x0ca/pv for and access to development for all our citizens  we are working for equality and solidarity and for a fair distribution of the resources of this planet that we share  \\ufeffmr  president, permit me, in these first words, after congratulating you on the assumption of your important office, to express the confidence that we have in your wisdom and exceptional experience in the matters which affect the states which constitute the united nations  also permit us to extend, on behalf of the government of the dominican republic, our congratulations and thanks to the general committee of our assembly over which you preside for the spontaneous initiative, which does it credit, of including item in the agenda of this thirtyfourth session of the general assembly  this item relates to measures for providing assistance to my country and to the commonwealth of dominica, a small country which, like our own, was cruelly battered by the fury of the hurricanes of this season of cyclones in the caribbean we must admit that this, too, represents a contribution to the peace for which the united nations is fighting so heroically, a contribution which takes into account in circumstances like these, not only the scourge of war, but also the destructive force of nature  this tragedy, which afflicts the peoples suffering from the results of the hurricanes, inevitably gives rise not only to hunger and destruction, but also to all the upsetting results produced when economies are disrupted and when human suffering reaches such depths that it bears comparison with what happens when war, an apocalyptic figure bent upon uprooting the constitutional instrument of the united nations, is unleashed our country was the victim in less than five days of two cruel hurricanes which spread tragedy, horror and chaos among its inhabitants, who were hoping for a future of peace and labour in a climate of democracy, and when the dominican government had already set up action programmes for the economic development of the nation and had been mobilizing all the forces of production, in many scientifically new and revolutionary areas, in order to make the best use of all the resources at our disposal these adversities have suddenly interrupted and damaged everything we had managed to achieve during the past year a report by ecla circulated to the representatives of the states members of this organization, reflects the extent of the damage caused in our country by the fury of these hurricanes  for the benefit of all the delegates here present, we should like to draw attention to the assessment contained in that document, which is available to all and which illustrates with reliable accuracy the disastrous situation from which the dominican people is now suffering like dominica, we are now confronting the unavoidable challenge of having to repair the tremendous damage which we have sustained and which has set back the process of development in which we were so earnestly and zealously engaged, while we continue to perform the difficult task of providing aid to the thousands of victims and survivors who are now in shelters and who are urgently calling for transfer to adequate, permanent housing  many of them still urgently need medical treatment in order to survive the catastrophe, which has given rise to hunger, poverty and other cruel sufferings in the calamitous situation through which the dominican republic is now passing, because of the devastation and damage caused by the hurricanes which passed through dominican territory in the months of august and september, causing so much damage to the inhabitants of the country and to private property, we must recognize that this world organization, its specialized agencies and the regional system, as well as many countries in the region of the americas and other parts of the world have come to the assistance of our country  that permits us to say that we are not alone in the formidable ordeal which the dominican nation is experiencing  we should also like to mention, in particular, undp, the office of the united nations disaster relief coordinator [undro], the world food programme and others which took such prompt and efficient action during the very first moments of the emergency this experience, arising from the destructive force of nature, prompts us to recall that the united nations has not only done what it is authorized to do in accordance with the constitutional principles by which it is governed, but has even gone beyond its sphere of competence on many occasions, in order to mitigate the effects of critical situations through humanitarian programmes, including assistance in the crises which from time to time afflict the territories of the states concerned nevertheless, these events have given the government of my country an idea which could bring a certain tranquillity and confidence to the islands such as our own, which are at a natural disadvantage, being right in the path of tropical hurricanes and being their first victims  this devastating danger threatens the economic structure of those countries, inevitably, each year, during the period of dangerous weather the plight of the antilles archipelago has led us, as we come to this thirtyfourth session of the general assembly of the united nations, to inform the secretarygeneral of the proposal of the president of the dominican republic, don antonio guzman, whereby, its characteristic spirit of affording protection and assistance to peoples, particularly to its member states, in its programme for peace, the world organization should decide to create a permanent specific fund, which would make it possible to render assistance to the islands in the caribbean in the tragic circumstances which unfortunately seem to recur every year without fail the dominican republic spirit of international cooperation—which prides itself on having been one of the founding members of this organization and of the american regional system—was highlighted recently in the peacemaking efforts which it undertook, together with the republic of guatemala and the united states of america, in order to find a solution to the conflict in the republic of nicaragua, which was on the point of spreading to other countries  this mission of mediation, carried out on a basis of equality and mutual respect which are essential elements of the law of nonintervention that is constitutionally guaranteed by this organization as well as by the interamerican legal system, exhausted our utmost efforts in that very difficult task which was throughout inflamed by the emotions aroused by a policy with heavily dynastic overtones the negotiations to find a constitutional formula which could put an end to the fratricidal war were blocked and, finally, peace had to be imposed by force of arms  nevertheless, the dominican republic does feel satisfaction at having taken the part of a mediator in that conflict in the search for a less distressing solution for the sister republic of nicaragua moreover, we must recognize that the establishment of nicaragua junta of national reconstruction has rescued democracy in that territory and we trust that it will be maintained in a lasting fashion  the problem of nicaragua is one of freedom, the cause for which countries fight that have adjured slavery and condemned it as an anachronistic phenomenon which has no place in presentday civilization in the same spirit of international cooperation, the dominican government supports the world energy plan proposed by mexico for all the countries of the world, without discrimination, whether or not they produce oil  the objective of that plan would be to provide for a progressive transition, in an orderly and just fashion, from the present historical process towards a new one which would provide many more realistic prospects for the progress of mankind by speaking of these things, the dominican government is performing the duty it has to pursue effective international cooperation, in the conviction that, despite the inherent competence of the organization of american states [cms], there is a constitutional link between our two organizations, the justification for which is the preservation of peace and the prevention of war as a method of solving disputes and conflicts among states the world organization, whose creation as a consequence of the second world war is one of the greatest historic events of the century, has not been able to escape criticism, some of it malicious, which branded it as incapable, in spite of the means it possesses, of preventing armed conflicts which have broken out and continue to break out in various parts of the world  those who make that judgement tend to overlook how difficult it is to maintain peace in a world which has not yet been able to free itself from the material and moral wounds inflicted on man and his ancient race by the two world wars nations reflect man imperfection, and therein lies the root of the evil which will last until the last judgement, but which we might perhaps avoid if, instead of accumulating nuclear weapons, multiple warhead weapons and guided missies, man is able to redeem himself in the centuries to come from the negative repercussions of his origins  we may rest secure, however, in the fact that our organization will be able to fulfil thoroughly, within a framework of indisputable realism, all the requirements for it to achieve its fundamental objectives the not entirely satisfactory events which have occurred since the signing of the charter years ago have been events which could be described as isolated, directly ascribable to the imperfection of men and nations  we must admit, however, that these accidental and sporadic aberrations have been caused, in large measure, by the very states which founded the organization  these states are responsible for the controversies and disputes, misunderstandings, lack of international cooperation and, above all, the lack of trust which prevails throughout the greater part of the world if this state of affairs is acceptable, what is no less acceptable is the fact that it is important to draw up an inventory of these imperfections of the historic process of the world organization which will demonstrate to us that one of the reasons for its existence is to prevent war and preserve peace  and this is something which has obviously been done, although international tensions, the cold war and geopolitics have succeeded in causing certain erosions in the advantages of peaceful coexistence for the benefit of all peoples who are fighting in the spirit of conviction—or convention—for the predominance of peace, and although in certain periods detente has succeeded in bringing about an easing of the anxiety generated by the arms race over the past year we have felt that the degree of progress achieved has yielded great relief for situations still awaiting solution which have been dragging on for several years  many cases of this kind could be cited as examples where in actual fact isolated, armed conflicts have not been able to degenerate into a war of aggression which has extended to such a vast scale as did the first and second world wars i think we would not be mistaken if we were to say, with a feeling of justice, how much more precarious the peace enjoyed by the world would have been if our organization had not existed  it does have defects, some of them congenital, such as the right of veto, which was essential to the very foundation of the organization, so much so that it was said at san francisco that if there had been no right of veto, there would have been no charter in recent years we must feel glad at the fact that several conflicts have not broadened into true war situations and that a careful, evolutionary diplomacy has succeeded in freezing these critical situations  just to mention two examples, let us recall the case of the middle east and that of central america, which is so recent in our memories nor can we refrain from alluding also to the spirit of camp david as well as the great and active sense of diplomatic patience displayed by the united kingdom in its peacemaking efforts in the anomalous situations in africa now on their way towards solutions conducive to political equilibrium at the african summit on the other hand, in considering the progress made in finalizing the implementation of the treaty of peace between egypt and israel signed on march  we cannot disregard the aspirations of the palestinians or fail to respect the solidarity of the arab nations, which have made such great contributions to the history of civilization  efforts must continue to be made, however, to find appropriate and honourable formulas for the restoration of peace within secure and permanent frontiers in this area of controversy a fact of the utmost importance which will go down as a new chapter in the history of the americas has just been written in panama city when, pursuant to the agreement between the united states of america and panama to finalize the status of that interoceanic canal which separates the two americas, one of the fundamental parts of the agreement has been complied with, leading in time to the total exercise of panamanian sovereignty over this maritime route this solution is indeed an example of how much can be achieved within the framework of justice and goodwill among states when farsighted men, united by the most lofty ideals, come to an agreement in their decisions face to face with the challenge of history in the midst of the tidal waves and storms of international politics, we must also concede that this world organization has made progress in many areas where international tensions and the cold war have kept today disturbed world in a state of expectancy  i am referring to the growing progress that is being achieved in the various areas of human rights the wisdom and good judgement of the commission on human rights, as part of the machinery of the united nations, should not be overlooked  this assertion would be incomplete if special reference were not made to an event of the utmost importance, affecting as it does human rights in the region of the americas and coinciding with violent explosions in certain areas where an entire freedomloving people was plunged into a bloodbath before it succeeded in winning back its freedom  this was indeed the case with nicaragua, as has also happened in other countries where it has still not been possible to control this evil, which seems to be on the decline at times but at others seems to be causing a new crisis with these references, we must recognize that the creation of the interamerican court of human rights, which has its seat in the nonmilitaristic capital of costa rica, completes the evolutionary process of human rights, which had already been initiated by the appropriate commission within the framework of the oas  and although it is true that it has brought to human rights an institution like that of the inter american court of human rights, it is none the less true that the accelerated changes in the political outlook of the americas require that a new injection of vigorous blood be given in order to adjust to the imperatives of our time in this part of the world we are sure that many member states will agree that this is an imperative necessity if they do not wish to see this regional organization languish in semistatism and decadence the court of the regional system is an innovation and an admirable experiment which should lead to beneficial experiences which will perhaps one day make it possible for there to exist in the world organization an organ of justice of the same kind but of wider scope as far as the dominican republic is concerned, we are in a position to assert here that we have made important progress in this area, as a projection of the integrated programmes of the dominican government for the development of the country  these programmes, now more than ever, require international conditions not likely to have an adverse effect on the efforts, which the head of the dominican state proposes to redouble, with vigour and energy, in all the country area of activity furthermore, the dominican republic wishes to reaffirm its support for the fundamental principles of international economic relations as expressed in the charter of economic rights and duties of states  here, as is the case with all the latin american countries and particularly those which produce commodities and raw materials, we would ex ort the developing countries to conduct their economic relations in such a way as to take into account the interests of other countries, particularly in order to avoid any action detrimental to the interests of the developing countries there exists an initiative which without doubt could be taken through dialogue within a framework of equality and mutual respect and adapted to the delicate conditions of the particular case, one that could serve to attenuate the risk to international security engendered by flashpoints of crisis  i refer to the establishment of a new international economic order in such a way as to provide the present era of civilization with what it clamours for there is also a welltested and extremely effective method for contributing to the solution of the problem of security  it is enshrined in the charter of this organization, and its application has produced positive results  this is the principle relating to the self determination of peoples  this is precisely the essence of the item relating to the implementation of the declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples over the years events have shown that the policy that has satisfied such aspirations of countries which have come to the end of an evolutionary process has proved to be correct and has justified their aspirations to become free and independent  the dominican republic, like all free countries of the americas, has had to go through that process  hence the situation prevailing in the region of the americas today  in the circumstances, the dominican people have lived and suffered through this experience and, whatever the vicissitudes to which we have been subjected by our destiny, absolutely all the sons of our land are also sons of liberty no matter how strewn with pitfalls is the life of free peoples, this is the road of peace and concord among men and nations  in this conviction we must recognize, in line with the thinking of the martyr of cuban independence, jose marti, the truth of the statement: our wine may be bitter but it is our wine therefore let us welcome with open arms that small island in the caribbean, saint lucia, as we see it entering the united nations as a member  in spite of its small size its spirit is broadened by its acceptance of the obligation imposed on it to proscribe war and to maintain peace in the world, and its dedication to the principles governing us all this idea of peace should be inculcated as a mystic teaching every day among men and nations, so that perhaps in the course of time it will cease to be a utopian idea and man can then say that he has achieved the impossible  therefore the dominican republic joins in the most recent initiative of costa rica for the creation, within the united nations system, of a university for peace  finally, permit me to invoke on this solemn occasion that provision of the charter which calls on all states members of the organization—and this is the comerstone of our policy for avoiding the scourge of war and is perhaps the synthesis of all the objectives justifying the very existence of the united nations— to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours  the dominican republic wishes to expressits gratitude for the gestures of solidarity expressed byfriendly countries with regard to the passage of the terriblehurricane, georges, which struck our country yesterday furthermore, we appeal to the generosity of theinternational community to provide cooperation with a viewto facing both the immediate emergencies of the populationaffected by this phenomenon and the process of nationalrecovery the delegation of the dominican republic, on behalfof the government presided over by mr  leonel fernández,wishes to extend its warmest congratulations to thepresident of the general assembly, the minister for foreignaffairs of uruguay, on his welldeserved election to presideover the fiftythird session, which is taking place at a timeof great structural changes in global society and within ourorganization  we also wish to thank mr  hennadiyudovenko, who presided over the deliberations of the lastsession of the general assembly with such skill  ourgratitude goes also to the secretarygeneral, mr  kofiannan, for his devotion and efforts to guide theorganization along the path towards modernization andreform, which will strengthen us as we reach the newmillennium the changes in the realities of the world in whichwe live make it necessary to revise international policy in this respect, the united nations, being the universalforum, must be strengthened and renewed by increasingits activities in areas such as peace and security ofnations, the protection of human rights and theenvironment and cooperation for socioeconomic andcultural development faithful to its principles, the united nations mustcontinue to encourage and deepen its programme ofreforms, taking into consideration not only the complexityof the current reality, but also the future development ofregulations aimed at relieving social marginalization andethnic and religious tensions, which jeopardize the priorityobjectives of peace and development for our peoples  thedominican republic expresses its firm support for thenegotiations and consultations on the programme ofreform  we trust that the process will culminate insubstantial changes in the various organs of the unitednations, enhancing their effectiveness and leading to amore democratic, transparent and representativeorganization, thus ensuring its ability to act to achieve itspresent objectives fortunately, the constant threat of a nuclear war hasdiminished  today, however, we are faced with thechallenge of combating together, and on a global scale,hunger, poverty, environmental destruction and theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, andencourage equitable development and free societies  wemust also struggle to lay the bases of economic growth there are other security problems that requiredecisive action: international terrorism, organized crimeand illicit trafficking in arms and drugs  we must createreliable instruments to put an end to these evils andachieve acceptable levels of security for our citizens sothat they can live in peace  the politics of security isinspired by the vision of a democratic world that practicessolidarity  security must be achieved on the basis ofpolitical, economic, social and ecological cooperation  theprinciple of sovereign equality of states and the beliefthat conflicts of interest must be resolved peacefullyrequire global cooperation because security can beachieved only with the participation of all states that task falls principally to the security council  thedominican republic believes it necessary to enlarge thecouncil by creating new seats for the regions of latinamerica, asia and africa, thus strengthening it in thefulfilment of its functions and allowing for greaterrepresentativity the dominican republic believes that internationalpeace and stability are prerequisites for a secure future formankind  democracy and respect for human rights, togetherwith justice and respect for the law, are the surest ways ofpreserving peace  general acceptance of these principlescannot be imposed, but it can be actively promoted the crisis spots that afflict large segments of theworld s population continue to be of concern to manystates  we emphasize the need to strengthen mechanismsof dialogue and negotiation in conflict areas such as thebalkans, the middle east and the great lakes region inafrica  with regard to the republic of china on taiwan,the dominican republic reiterates the positions presentedby its president, mr  leonel fernández, with regard to theneed for the international community to consider theimportance of that country, due to its geographic location,for the peace, security and prosperity of that region  wefavour constructive dialogue between both sides of thetaiwan strait to bring about understanding and mutualcooperation  we reiterate that the parallel participation ofboth countries in the united nations would be conducive tothe maintenance of peace the dominican republic is also committed to theprocess of nuclear disarmament and vigorously protests therecent nuclear tests, as these can endanger world peace  wereaffirm the need for strict respect for international treatieson the prohibition, emplacement and testing of nuclearweapons, in the atmosphere, in the oceanic subsoil and onthe ocean floor  we urge nuclearweapon states to use andhandle those weapons responsibly as the only protection forthose of us who do not have that type of defence  thepreservation of world peace demands that member statesof the united nations establish new nuclearweaponfreezones and protect those already existing as a guarantee ofsecurity concern for the preservation of a zone free of nuclearcontamination is shared by the nations of the caribbean,which is used as a transportation route for toxic and nuclearwastes  for those countries among us that depend largelyon tourism based on sun and beaches, the coastal waterquality is vital to that important sector of our economies ongoing trafficking in illicit arms represents anotherthreat to security  the arms buildup must definitively bestopped  the relevant international conventions signed bythe dominican republic are very important, such as theone on illicit trafficking in conventional weapons peaceful settlement of conflicts by means ofdialogue and accord is the best method to eliminate theuse of force in political relations within and amongmember countries  for that reason, it is necessary toenhance the efforts and mechanisms recognized byinternational law in order to resolve internationalconflicts  in that context, the dominican republic acceptsand defends multilateralism as the appropriate way ofachieving consensus on the main problems that afflict theworld population  poverty, drugtrafficking, terrorism,interethnic and territorial conflicts are problems that mustnot be dealt with unilaterally for that reason we support the strengthening ofestablished international systems of justice  the signingof the statute of the international criminal court isurgently needed to achieve these ends  we believe thatthe instruments to protect peace must be used beforeconflicts occur  the united nations must take preventiveaction and respond rapidly and effectively to avoid laterconsequences  in that respect, the convention on theelimination of antipersonnel landmines, signed by manymember states of the united nations at ottowa, canada,constitutes an important step and commitment towards theconsolidation of mechanisms for world peace firmly based on the principle of encouraging thepeaceful resolution of disputes and the search for peaceand security in our region, the dominican republic haspromoted the strengthening of its neighbourly relations for the first time in more than half a century, adominican president visited the republic of haiti  thatevent and the agreements reached favour the effortsundertaken by the democratic governments of both statesthrough dialogue and accord, which is the best way toapproach their common problems it is in this new context of our bilateral relations thatwe wish to appeal to the international community tocontinue to provide support to haiti  the need thatbrought about the commitment of the united nations tothe recovery of our neighbouring country still remains the dominican republic has met the challenges ofworld changes at the end of this century  the restorationof diplomatic relations with the fraternal country of cubaconstituted an inevitable step that formalized our longlasting relations with cuba our country seeks inclusion in the integrationist trendin our geographic and geopolitical area  thus, this year wesigned two freetrade treaties, one with the five countries ofcentral america, and the other with the members of thecaribbean community  both agreements are modern,advanced and comprehensive, as they deal with trade ingoods and services and with investment and are in keepingwith the principles of the world trade organization  theyare conducive to economic growth, the creation of moreand better jobs and improvement in the quality of life ofour citizens other clear signs of this regional rapprochement andparticipation are the two presidential events held in ourcountry  in november the city of santo domingo wasthe site of the extraordinary summit of heads of state of thecentral american countries, including belize, as well as ofthe dominican republic, and more recently, in august ofthis year, of the extraordinary meeting of heads of state andgovernment of the caribbean forum  both meetings led toagreements and concrete positions regarding hemisphericand global challenges that our region must confront at the same time, we have tightened our economic,political and development ties with the other nations of ourregion, through the presence of our president, mr  leonelfernández, at the summit of the americas and the iberoamerican summit through bilateral visits and exchanges atthe presidential level with the united states, mexico,venezuela and colombia, countries with which wetraditionally share close bonds  these regular presidentialexchanges have led to consensus on basic topics on theinternational agenda and have deepened our levels ofcooperation allow me now to speak out the values of democracyfrom a basically social approach, since people are the trueand ultimate raison d être of democracy  human rights andfundamental freedoms will be fully respected andguaranteed only when each citizen has a reasonable lifeexpectancy with access to health systems and theopportunity for education in a healthy ecologicalenvironment as is well known, in order to achieve these objectives,large public expenditures in these areas are necessary  twofactors make this difficult: the external debt, a heavyburden which has dragged us down since the , and thecurrent financial crisis, which affects various countries ofthe world, including some in latin america  both factorsdrain away resources that could have financed socialdevelopment in this part of the world  the consequencesare obvious  unable to improve the living conditions ofour people and help them become integrated into theglobal economy, poverty grows and democracy andstability are weakened the greatest problem facing the internationalcommunity is how to deal with the enormous economicand social imbalance from which most member statessuffer, with the gap between the rich and the poorcountries and with the growth in global poverty  the roleof the united nations should be strengthened informulating and coordinating policies for cooperation andin providing technical and financial assistance todeveloping countries human resources must take priority during thecurrent transformation of the international, political andeconomic order  women in particular must play animportant role, as they constitute a dedicated, responsibleand active workforce and give us reasons to seehumankind as being at the centre of development andprogress the dominican republic understands thatstrengthening the role of women in the political, socialand economic life of member states is essential if we areto reduce poverty and social inequality and promotedemocracy and sustainable development  that is why it isessential to give priority to policies and programmes thatbroaden women s participation in these areas we vigorously support the objectives and work ofthe united nations international research and traininginstitute for the advancement of women (instraw) the plans to improve the contribution of women to thedevelopment of their countries, in accordance with theirown needs, set up when instraw was created,continues to be of primary importance and deservescontinued support from member states creating a new international order is a politicalchallenge  the conditions for this new order require themultilateral system to guarantee security and governabilitywithin the framework of respect for human rights  incelebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the universaldeclaration of human rights, which has been a guidinglight for building a more just world, we hope that respectfor human rights will become daily practice for allpeople in conclusion, we believe that the united nations mustreflect on and accept the changes that are necessary for ourorganization  that is why we enthusiastically support thereform programme, which will hope will respond to theexpectations of a united nations in tune with our time  \\ufeffallow me first of all to express my most sincere congratulations to mr  illueca on his election to the presidency of the thirtyeighth session of the general assembly, an election which has a special meaning for the countries of latin america and the caribbean  our regional group is proud and honoured at his election, since his wellknown skill and experience will ensure that the work of this session will be guided to a successful conclusion this is a fitting occasion to highlight the work accomplished by the outgoing president, mr  imre hollai, who so ably led the proceedings of the thirtyseventh session since my country is a member of the great family of the caribbean, we are pleased to welcome most cordially the new free, sovereign and independent state of saint christopher and nevis to the organization  we share with our brothers of that new nation their legitimate satisfaction at having exercised the most sacred rights of peoples: selfdetermination  our country was gratified to be present at the celebration of the national independence of this fraternal country and to bring a message of friendship and cooperation from the dominican government and the people, reaffirming once again the caribbean focus of the present policy of the dominican republic we come to this thirtyeighth session deeply concerned at the continued deterioration of various aspects of the international scene  the crises afflicting peace loving nations require of the organization a joint effort to seek the means and machinery to face the problems and find appropriate solutions this great effort should be characterized by active international cooperation with the united participation of all the members of the united nations at this difficult time in the history of mankind international cooperation, which is an essential element for harmonious coexistence among nations, must be the force behind our actions if we are to overcome the present situation at this stage of international life, the major decisions of concern to mankind should not be the purview of a small and exclusive group of nations  our country looks for more dynamic international cooperation reflected in all areas—mainly in the political, economic, scientific and cultural spheres—so that the major decisions reached on issues of great importance to all may be backed by a feeling of unity and solidarity, which is essential for their effective implementation the undeniable interdependence of nations, an essential characteristic of contemporary international relations, makes it necessary that international cooperation be based essentially on solidarity—a solidarity which can contribute decisively to the genuine development of peoples at the present time, when the international community is troubled by conflicts, tension and anguish, we must draw attention to article  paragraph of the charter, which daily assume more significance in international relations: all members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered the preservation of peace is the fundamental duty of the united nations  to prevent and eliminate threats to international peace and security by means of peaceful settlement of disputes is a commitment which binds all members, especially the permanent members of the security council we fully agree with the secretarygeneral when, in his annual report on the work of the organization [y/v], he points out that it is the weakening of this commitment that has, perhaps more than any other factor, led to the partial paralysis of the united nations as the guardian of international peace and security in view of the present conflicts, tensions and distress, it is urgent and necessary that we reaffirm our readiness to heed the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes, for that principle is the very foundation of harmonious coexistence among peoples in an analysis of the problems afflicting the world, we cannot omit the grave danger posed by the headlong arms race pursued by the superpowers  we must therefore express our concern at the virtual paralysis of disarmament negotiations  faced with the apocalyptic image of a nuclear holocaust, the international community must demand that the big powers make greater efforts which could lead to effective agreements and to their speedy implementation the dominican republic considers that we must now reaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equality of rights of men and women and of nations large and small  we must fight to create conditions in which it will be possible to maintain justice and respect for obligations stemming from treaties and other sources of international law it was with wellfounded pride that the dominican head of state, mr  salvador jorge blanco, declared, when he set forth the foreign policy of the country on the occasion of the first anniversary of his government, we have maintained a line of conduct which respects all the principles and norms of international law a prerequisite for giving effect to legitimate aspirations for a lasting and stable peace in the world community is the search for just and viable solutions to the many international conflicts facing us among those conflicts, that in the middle east deserves special attention  we reiterate our conviction that the problems of that troubled region of the world have shown that the question of palestine is one of the decisive factors in the crisis  hence we believe that there can be no effective and lasting solution in the absence of arrangements enabling the palestinian people to exercise its inalienable right of selfdetermination, as has been recognized by this world organization at the thirtyseventh session my country, together with the great majority of the states members of the organization, supported the right of the palestinian people to establish a state on palestinian territory  likewise, we reiterate our view that any peaceful solution in this troubled region must take into account security council resolution (, which endorses, infer the right of the state of israel to exist we are also concerned about the situation in lebanon  we hope that the recently announced ceasefire will be effective and will promote constructive dialogue, putting an end to that grave conflict and ensuring the territorial integrity and sovereignty of that torn nation the dominican republic, which has always maintained a policy of nonintervention in the internal affairs of other states and is convinced that this is the essential basis of peace, is concerned at the foreign intervention in chad, in afghanistan and in kampuchea in violation of the principles of the charter of the united nations furthermore, we support the longdesired unification of the korean people in a sovereign state by means of an agreement consistent with the objectives of the charter nor can we remain silent about our frustration when we see that the just cause of the independence of the namibian people has moved no further towards success, in spite of the appeals of the international community from the very day the present government of the dominican republic took office it has constantly expressed its profound concern over the crisis affecting the central american region  we cannot forget that since we met at the thirtyseventh session the central american conflict has noticeably worsened through a rise in violence, border incidents and other factors which have steadily increased the threat of a widespread military conflagration that could endanger the peace of the continent the dominican republic has always associated itself with the responsible advocates of political understanding, of a peaceful solution resulting from constructive dialogue, and of the elimination of ageold obstacles which, rooted in underdevelopment, social injustice and a lack of democratic institutions, are the root causes of this serious conflict involving brother peoples whose legitimate demands are in every way understandable foreign interference, the unbridled arms race and ideological approaches that would place the problem in the framework of a broad and exclusive confrontation between the superpowers, are powerful contributing factors in a decisive worsening of the situation none the less, all is not bleak for the future of the region  faced with the concern and legitimate interest of many peoples, organizations and political forces and with the demands of an international community which is deeply concerned and determined to avoid an allout war or the slow and ruinous process of a chronic crisis like that in the middle east, the surrounding countries have taken the significant step of forming the contadora group, which has earned unanimous international support, with my country among the first to praise its efforts the contadora group has carried out praiseworthy work  it has built a cordon sanitaire that can prevent a widespread war, the dangerous military solution, whose political and social costs would be lethal to the development of the peoples of the area and to their legitimate desires for democracy and freedom  such a questionable solution would be essentially a temporary one and would in the short term be a startingpoint for new stages of tension and violence and would without doubt carry with it still greater risks  in the worst case, it would be the execrable peace of extermination of which the illustrious roman historian warned in his celebrated annual furthermore, the contadora group has created a framework for dialogue through which concrete proposals have been made on the basis of which a just, viable and lasting peace in central america could be built the elements of those proposals should lead, in the regional framework, in accordance with the cancun declaration, to control of the arms race; the elimination of foreign advisers; the creation of demilitarized zones; the prohibition of the use of       some states for the development of political or military destabilization actions in other states; the eradication of transit of and traffic in arms; and the prohibition of other forms of aggression or interference in the internal affairs of any country in the area  [seethe cancun line of thinking, the essence of which is regional political understanding based on respect for the principles of noninterference and the selfdetermination of peoples, necessarily implies a strengthening of democratic institutions, the guarantee of the observance of human rights and a programme of socioeconomic development leading to social justice recently, in a significant forward step, the central american nations ratified a document of objectives which were formulated, on the basis of the cancun declaration, in panama at the beginning of september of course, it will now be a matter of implementing those agreements, and we are neither deceiving ourselves nor being pessimistic if we say in a sense of realism that that implementation will be difficult, that it will be an arduous task, given the extreme complexity of the factors fuelling the central american tragedy aware of that reality, the presidents of the contadora countries stated the following:we appeal to all members of the international community, especially those which have expressed sympathy with the efforts of the contadora group, and to the secretarygeneral of the united nations and the chairman of the permanent council of the organization of american states, to contribute, with their experience and diplomatic capability, to the search for peaceful solutions to the problems of central america  that appeal may be a realistic one  as has been stated, what is at issue is a complex problem with roots that are regional but magnified in many ways by interests alien to the region  the implementation of the panama agreements—what might be described as an attempt at a central american peace project—will require concrete, broad and significant support for the contadora group by the international community the dominican republic has always considered that contadora should be complemented by efforts of many types to remove obstacles and facilitate the implementation of agreements and solutions recently, the president, mr  salvador jorge blanco, in a statement made during the celebration of his first year in office, said:the dominican republic clear position in favour of central american peace not only has been expressed in statements and declarations but has also been reflected in wideranging conversations and resolute action with heads of state and ministers of other nations, which have led to several official visits to our country an unshakable readiness for dialogue, good offices, mediation and contribution to all efforts likely to generate favourable conditions for peace in central america is and always will be a constant of the foreign policy of the dominican republic, based not only on the duty of solidarity of all nations in the light of the principles of the international legal order but also on the fact that it is a caribbean nation with a legitimate interest in preserving peace in a region in which, if it were caught up in a total military escalation, the security and institutionally of many nations such as our own would be endangered in my statement at the thirtyseventh session  i referred to an event in the south atlantic which deeply touched latin america and prompted a united reaction in support of argentina just territorial claims it is an unassailable fact that until the situation of the malvinas islands is resolved in a just and peaceful way it will continue to be a source of serious concern to our region  we therefore cordially urge the governments of argentina and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland to resume negotiations to find as soon as possible a peaceful solution to the dispute concerning sovereignty over the malvinas islands the dominican republic reaffirms once again in this world forum its forceful condemnation of the policy of apartheid, which we consider to be a crime against humanity  similarly, we condemn and reject all forms of discrimination as a violation of human dignity the dominican republic has expressed in the security council its regret and concern at the tragedy of the korean passenger aircraft and affirmed that that unhappy occurrence that cost the lives of innocent people and deeply touched the conscience of the international community must not be repeated in any circumstances we reiterate that that tragic event must not prevent the continuation of efforts to ensure detente, disarmament and peace on the occasion of the thirtyfifth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights, the dominican republic cannot fail to record its strict observance of the norms and provisions of international conventions and instruments on human rights we repeat our conviction that respect for human rights constitutes a common good the protection of which is recognized in the norms of international law  we therefore affirm that respect for the fundamental rights of the human person is one of the most effective means of achieving peaceful coexistence for the member states of the international community during the last session we stated that the dominican republic unreservedly condemned violations of human rights in any part of the world, and we say it again today with equal conviction and force the universal declaration of human rights, in its article  enshrines cultural rights, that is, the right to participate in the cultural life of the community  we consider that the benefits of education, science and art must be shared by all and that every man and woman must be in a position to exercise his or her creative faculties  in this connection, we support in particular cultural exchanges and international cooperation as effective means of strengthening the spiritual links between peoples to ensure the harmonious and just development of all human activities, it is essential to improve the status and rights of women  at the national level, the dominican government has created in santo domingo a general bureau for the advancement of women  at the global level, i am particularly pleased to refer now to the recent inauguration in santo domingo of the headquarters of the international research and training institute for the advancement of women, a permanent united nations agency for that purpose, our government donated the building in which the institute has established its headquarters  with that contribution the dominican republic has expressed its resolute support for the cause of women and their full integration in the political, economic, social and cultural life and in the process of development in those various sectors   the grave economic crisis afflicting the international community continues to be a source of great concern  few countries have recorded any economic growth recently  the stagnation of trade is evident, the prices of raw materials remain depressed and the industrialized countries, in their effort to emerge from the quagmire of recession, are maintaining protectionist measures that obstruct free international trade the worldwide recession has, without any doubt, hit the underdeveloped world the hardest, as it lacks the industrial and financial potential and the social and technological development of the industrialized countries the thirdworld countries continue to face growing external indebtedness, generated mainly by the accumulation of balanceofpayment deficits, the flight of capital, the sharp decline in the gross national product, and fiscal deficits that cannot be financed  in some of them galloping inflation and mass unemployment persist  moreover, our countries are experiencing a gradual contraction of income because of a deterioration in the terms of trade as a result of a decline in commodity prices and continued protectionist measures by the industrialized countries, to which we have already referred the dominican republic, as a developing country highly dependent on its exports of commodities, has of course not been able to escape the effects of the international economic crisis we must nevertheless point out that it has been an accomplishment of our government, through rational and sound management of resources and of the nation funds, not only to maintain and strengthen social peace and democratic institutions, but also to begin genuine economic recovery in many aspects  in this connection, in a recent issue of a major european magazine specializing in economic affairs, the dominican republic appears among the top countries of the developing world with a healthy economy and in fourth place in the americas  likewise, our country has been placed twenty seventh among all those countries in the world with regard to economies practiced to control inflation we know, however, that the major goals for full development will not be achieved without the concurrence of efforts and action by the international community to create a new and more just economic order among the peoples of the world at the fifth ministerial meeting of the group of  in preparation for the sixth session of the united nations conference on trade and development, the developing countries adopted the buenos aires platform, which contains important statements with a view to reactivation of the world economy and accelerated development of the thirdworld countries, mainly in the areas of international trade, commodities, financing and other relevant issues in spite of the disappointing results of the sixth session, we consider that the statements in the buenos aires platform constitute the most coherent basis for the promotion of the northsouth dialogue and for eventual global negotiations from which the new international economic order may result, giving full effect to the economic rights enshrined in the universal declaration of human rights the frustrating experience of belgrade prompts us, furthermore, to reaffirm the need to strengthen and increase southsouth cooperation as one of our main responses to the crisis we are pleased to recognize that our region has begun to take significant steps with determination and energy, following the example of simon bolivar, the liberator, whose bicentenary we are enthusiastically celebrating indeed, the countries of latin america and the caribbean have begun a process of harmonizing measures enabling the region to face the present crisis, through the development of its capacity for action and strengthening its systems of cooperation  that process is a response to the initiative of the president of ecuador, mr  osvaldo hurtado larrea, strongly supported by the dominican president, mr  salvador jorge blanco, with the collaboration of the latin american economic system [laes] and ecla, whose work concluded with the socalled santa domingo commitment, adopted by countries at the meeting of personal representatives of heads of state or government of latin america and the caribbean, held from to august at santo domingo in his statement opening that meeting, the president of the dominican republic stated the following:in keeping with our conviction as men of the americas, we are fully at one with the idea of establishing a latin american strategy expressed in a concurrence of views for negotiating with the industrialized countries and at the same time for uniting the will of our government concerning the need to implement integrationist policies, both in international trade and in areas of production, energy, transport, technological development and other basic sectors of the economy of our peoples in the santo domingo commitment, urgent attention is given to the adoption of a joint plan of action concentrating primarily on the areas of promoting and strengthening regional cooperation and integration, fostering intraregional trade and supplying food, energy and services and on international financial and monetary problems the specific elements of the joint plan of action will be considered and formalized at a high political level at a latin american economic conference to be held at quito in january  it will be convened by the president of ecuador, in consultation with the other governments of latin america and the caribbean  preparatory work has been entrusted to a group over which we have the honour of presiding and which also includes peru, argentina, jamaica, ecuador and costa rica recently, at caracas, the ninth regular meeting of the latin american council of sela took place  its main resolutions are aimed at strengthening the regional negotiating capacity  of particular interest is resolution  relating to latin american and caribbean support for the convening of the abovementioned latin american economic conference at quito the developing countries require the priority attention of multilateral financial institutions in order to resolve their financing and international trading problems, as these have a negative impact on the wellbeing of their peoples, affecting their pace of development and the appropriate level of domestic economic activity, which leads to an increase in social and political tensions while we recognize the efforts made by imf to help countries in their adjustment processes, we understand that the terms involved in the financial stabilization programmes inherent in these processes need to be more flexible and that the financing bodies need to be strengthened through provision of the resources they need to carry out their task  in this connection, we are deeply concerned at the decision of the interim committee of imf to reduce the annual lending capacity of imf to per cent of the quota  finally, the delegation of the dominican republic, which i have the honour to preside over, wishes to appeal to human conscience, to all those who bear on their shoulders the heavy responsibilities of the destiny of their respective countries, so that given the serious political and economic crisis that threatens the very existence of mankind, wisdom and mutual respect may prevail instead of the violence that generates the worst of evils  this would indubitably promote a better understanding, which would open the doors to cooperation and solidarity among peoples, the supreme objectives of the united nations  on behalf of the dominican delegation and on my own behalf i take great pleasure in congratulating mr  carlos sosa rodriguez, the representative of venezuela, on his election as president of the eighteenth session of the general assembly of the united nations the fact that dr  sosa rodriguez will direct the debates and work of this session of the assembly is in itself a guarantee of its success  the outstanding qualities of the new president have become manifest during the years in which he has served with distinction and brilliance as representative of his country in this world organization and in other diplomatic posts his tact, moderation, sound judgement, conscientiousness and legal abilities augur well that the problems facing the united nations will be approached and considered in the way that will most benefit mankind now and in the future the dominican people, as a member of the family of american nations, are glad that a representative of our group will serve as president of this general assembly and, even more so, that he is a worthy representative of the country of bolívar  this is so because the dominican people owe a debt of gratitude to the people of venezuela as their most steadfast supporters in the arduous struggle to free themselves from the cruel tyranny to which they had been subject for more than thirty years the dominican republic stands before you today painfully shaken by the recent events that have caused the suspension of the constitutional rule which began on february of this year  the facts, true or false, have been reported in all quarters of the world, and have aroused great uncertainty we are the first to regret what has occurred, but in the face of the accomplished fact and completely alien to it, we have acceded to the appeal of the people, and, without any political commitments other than those imposed by the need to help the country and the desire to restore as quickly as possible the constitutionality that has been suspended, we have assumed the duties of the foreign office in order to strengthen international relations and thus contribute to the process of reconstruction which is necessary whenever the democratic progress of a nation has been interrupted we do not condone coups d'état and would never have agreed to participate in the present government if the military authorities had arrogated to themselves the right to rule the state  now that the military authorities have discharged what they considered to be their duty, they have established an auspicious precedent in america by handing over control of the government quickly and of their own accord to a threeman civil executive, to which they are completely subordinate and which the overwhelming majority of the people accept and support, realizing the integrity and prudence of the men who compose it we offer our friendship to those nations with which we have traditionally maintained relations, and we wish to be received in like manner  this is essential if we are to carry forward the process of transformation inevitable in the world of today, in which manifest inequalities among men anger those who lack all material possessions and harden the hearts of the privileged who are surrounded by abundance  we will never, however, make the task which we are in duty bound to carry out in our nation dependent on our recognition or nonrecognition our mission will be fulfilled  and, just as the traveller who must reach a certain destination does not abandon his journey for lack of a vehicle, we shall reach that destination  if we go on foot, we shall reach it more slowly; if we go by automobile, we shall reach it more quickly  but there can be no doubt that we intend to reach that goal and shall reach it however difficult the road may be the generation in the dominican republic to which i have the honour to belong accepts the challenge of fate, and with all the respect which we owe to the memory of our forebears, we shall break the shackles of the semifeudal, patriarchal or interventionist systems which have regrettably produced social conditions that affront the dignity of the worker and the peasant  the forum of the united nations is an appropriate place to declare emphatically that santo domingo will, despite reverses, become through the efforts of its people, a showcase of democracy, founded on a revolutionary process that is genuinely our own as president kennedy once said, lost opportunities are seldom recovered  the dominican republic may very well prove to be an exception to that rule  if the lessons of the tragedy which our longsuffering country has undergone are correctly learnt, the opportunity of democracy will not have been lost democracy in the dominican republic did not fail because the people were inadequately prepared to assume their responsibilities  the first genuinely free elections which were held in the dominican republic in december after three decades of political obscurantism proved the contrary  that they were model elections has been confirmed by some forty distinguished representatives from the hemisphere who were invited to observe them at the request of the dominican council of state  the failure of democratic government in the dominican republic was the fault of its leaders  democracy did not fail; the dominican people showed their discipline and responsibility at the ballot box  we, their leaders, failed our people  we must all assume a share of the responsibility for the failure of the administration  the bitter truth is that democracy was very badly served in the dominican republic  this is one of the first lessons that must be learnt this fiasco in the past of the dominican republic should be regarded as a prologue to its future  the second lesson to be learnt from the experience of the dominican republic is that latin american problems are primarily political and only secondarily economic  in our preoccupation with economic development, we have lost sight of its political aspect  within the alliance for progress a comprehensive strategy for economic development has been set in motion  however, what we really need in latin america is an overall strategy of political development, together with the political tactics necessary to bring it to fruition would it not be more prudent to bring all the forces of the hemisphere to bear on the creation of stronger movements based upon democratic foundations and firmly supported by democratic traditions  would it not be more salutary to devise methods to prevent extremists of the right or the left from destroying the political keystone of a middleoftheroad democracy  in other words, can we in latin america achieve justice unless there first exists a political atmosphere favourable to democracy  in our exclusive preoccupation with economic development we seem to be forgetting these facts the third lesson to be learnt from the dominican question is that the small core of progressive and reformminded governments in latin america is in greater danger of being overturned by preventive coups d'état than by external enemies  the participation of the armed forces in politics is not peculiar to latin america; it is a universal phenomenon  it exists in the middle east, in turkey, in pakistan and in southeast asia  it is not unknown in western europe  even in the united states the absolute supremacy of the civil authorities has been defied on various occasions  in the western hemisphere, only three countries have succeeded in overthrowing the supremacy of the military  in each case, however, this was achieved through the violent overthrow of the entire social structure  in other countries of the hemisphere, there has been a progressive growth and a maturing of the military establishments, but this does not mean that the military have everywhere abandoned their political interests  recent events, including those in the dominican republic, prove the contrary  the point is that the participation of the military in politics in latin america has taken very deep roots and has become too entrenched an institution to be eradicated at one stroke  it is well to remember that on more than one occasion in the western hemisphere it was the civilian authorities who persuaded the military to engage in political activity democratic governments with a progressive outlook must be protected from the demagogues, from the coup d'état of ambitious men and from the political manoeuvrings of unscrupulous politicians who, together or separately, attempt to satisfy their ambitions by playing upon the ignorance and poverty of the people  i emphasize these three dangers because i think it is unjust to put the blame for all the evils of latin america on the armed forces, which have often made remarkable efforts to overcome their own imperfections  this happened in the specific case of the dominican republic, where despite the errors that were made, the armed forces have given positive evidence that they have every intention of discharging their duty it is absurd to hope that the interamerican system, as a unit, can serve as a kind of hemispheric shield to protect its individual members against internal attack  nevertheless, such a shield could and certainly should be forged through the resolution and efforts of the people themselves if democracy is to flourish on the continent we believe in nations as we believe in their statesmen  and because we believe in their statesmen, we know that in these difficult times in which many countries of our continent have fallen victim to the defects which we should like to correct, these men will in this solemn hour act not according to sterile political conventions but in accordance with a humane understanding of their people and of the individuals who compose them in the dominican republic, the present government could have promised a return to constitutional normality by offering to hold elections before the appointed time it had set for the fulfilment of its mandate, which is not to exceed two years and during which municipal, congressional and presidential election are to be held, the firstmentioned immediately after the end of the first year of government elections such as those of last december — encompassing in one single poll municipal councillors; municipal executive representatives; representatives to congress, that is deputies and senators; representatives to the assembly for the revision of the constitution; the vicepresident and president of the republic— would produce results as surprising as the previous ones, because the dominican people, despite the difficulties of their life, have a kind of instinct which leads them along peaceful paths in the decisive moments of their history  they gave proof of this in their fight against the armed dictatorship of trujillo and again when they went to the polls on december  elections would undoubtedly be a further manifestation of democracy, but, in view of the bitter experience that we have already undergone, we ask ourselves whether this manifestation of democracy would be the final proof that we had achieved democracy and that further risks had been eliminated with obsessive interest, we ask ourselves what is the meaning of democracy  and in doing so, we cannot fail to note the concluding paragraphs of the statement made by the united states assistant secretary of state, mr  edwin m  martin, published in the new york herald tribune of october, in which he said: i fear there are some who will accuse me of having written an apologia for coups  i have not  they are to be fought with all the means we have available  rather i would protest that i am urging the rejection of the thesis of the french philosophers that democracy can be legislated —established by constitutional fiat  i am insisting on the anglosaxon notion that democracy is a living thing which must have time and soil and sunlight in which to grow  we must do all we can to create these favorable conditions, and we can do and have done much  but we cannot simply create the plant and give it to them; it must spring from seeds planted in indigenous soil  these are the seeds which we wish to plant in our own sorely beset country, for we firmly believe that democracy has its roots in the primary political cell of society, whether it be called municipality, city, corporation, town, village, borough, canton or anything else  we are thus convinced that only when man is able to govern himself freely and by his own efforts, resources and incentives in his own small locality and thus to transform it into a small paradise of which he may be proud, will he be equally able to govern that aggregate of localities, great and small, which make up the nation  we want to begin our task of planting the seed in our own soil and thereby constructing a democracy from the base up to the apex and not from the top down to the bottom we shall start by constructing the dominican municipality so that it can govern itself and will not be dominated by the central government along with which it is elected, and so that its destiny will not be directed by political bosses from an office in the national palace  the continuity of the legislative power must become a firmly established practice; the legislature must he partially renewed so that the national government will not have to rely on inexpert legislators submissive to its every demand  we wish to establish an autonomous career judiciary, so that the judges will not owe political servitude to the chief of state and pay lipservice to him which might threaten democracy  we wish to establish a balance of powers so that democracy, which is social equilibrium, shall not be forced to maintain that equilibrium with the absolute power of a single man in one plate of the balance and the sabre of the army in the other in order to accomplish this task we shall again make use of the technical assistance which the organization of american states offered us during the last elections  the effectiveness of that assistance was proved then, and it will be confirmed again on this occasion when we shall have the time which we did not then have the dominican republic, per cent of whose population are peasants, cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the spiritual and material poverty that is the lot of this majority, which has not so far received any positive benefit from the social advances that have been made in the course of the twentieth century  the dominican peasant, like those of the majority of our sister countries of latin america, is still subject to the rigours of a permanent outdoor life  his work is bedevilled by a system which leads to the perpetuation of his poverty through indifference towards ignorance and disease and the exploitation of his illusions by the false promises of a succession of candidates who, when they achieve power, ignore those promises or put off their fulfilment indefinitely practical and immediate justice for the worker in the fields, on whose labour the present and future of the dominican republic depend, must be forthcoming during the tenure of the civilian government which today guides the destinies of my country  it has an obligation to its people, who, on december last year, cast their vote not for a man or a political party, but for reforms in the economic and social structure of the country which would bring to the homes of the wretched masses not only freedom from hatred but also the possibility of adequate nourishment, of living under their own roof, of cultivating a piece of land of their own and of educating their children  those promises were unfortunately postponed so as to make way for a series of political adventures which smashed into a thousand pieces the hopes of the dominican people it is the duty of this government —if it is to justify itself before history— to carry out in a spirit free from demagogic motivation whatever efforts may be necessary to restore the faith of the dominican people in their ability to achieve a better life along the broad highway of representative democracy  it should be pointed out that progress towards this goal will be slower if the political and economic sanctions deriving from certain international pronouncements are kept in force  i must, however, emphatically declare that it is the firm decision of this government to mobilize all the resources at its command in order to realize the legitimate desires of the dominican people to free their nation from the status of an economic satellite as a first step in our resolve to set to work without delay, i make a formal request from this world rostrum to the secretarygeneral of the united nations for this organization to help us immediately by providing technicians who can proceed as speedily as possible to santo domingo to study the legislation that may be necessary to guarantee to the peasants of my country a minimum return from their labour  i wish to put forward the idea that, just as the worker enjoys a minimum wage for his daily hours of work, so the peasant, who cannot limit his working day to a certain number of hours because of factors beyond his control, should have the assurance that when the harvest is in, his efforts will have guaranteed a minimum decent life for him and his family latin america, which is basically agricultural, must answer without further delay the anguished cry of an immense majority of peasants whose fate can no longer be left in the hands of those who have exploited them in the past or of the dreamers of today who wish to remedy injustice with empty words and insubstantial promises i should like, before concluding, to explain the dominican position on foreign policy, the essence of which was set out in the statement made by the chief of government when he took office and is as follows: now that absolute tranquillity has been assured throughout the nation together with the full exercise of power by the triumvirate over which i have the honour to preside, i wish to refer to the very important matter of the foreign policy which the dominican government will follow and which can be summed up in the unshakable decision to honour ail international commitments undertaken in the name of the republic  within the framework of the interamerican system, it will be our constant concern to strengthen our ties with the sister countries of america and to fortify the organization of american states, that regional organization which has so consistently and effectively come to the aid of our country in moments of deepest anxiety  and thus will it be possible to convert into reality the programmes designed to give effect to the concepts of the charter of punta del este, so that the alliance for progress may continue more rapidly to assist in improving the level of living of the dominican people  this is the supreme goal of the triumvirate, which is convinced of the urgent need for reconstructing the economic and social life of the country, so that the overwhelming majority of the people may be provided with the maximum opportunity for betterment  in referring to this economic and social aspect of the undertakings given at punta del este, we do not wish to leave unmentioned the obligations deriving from the eighth meeting of consultation of ministers of foreign affairs, which likewise took place at punta del este   the triumvirate will endeavour with all the means at its disposal, to offer the western world its fullest cooperation both in the united nations and at every international conference in which the future of america is involved i shall conclude by recalling that although in this difficult moment of its history the dominican republic is cut off from diplomatic relations with the governments of latin america, it does not forget the fraternal ties that bind it to a race which has suffered so much precisely because it has been wanting in the mutual understanding that should exist among peoples having a common ancestry so that they might rediscover their own destiny, which cannot be forged except by ourselves santo domingo, steeped in history and the pride of a whole race, regrets that it is unable to greet those governments which have not yet officially granted recognition to ours, but it enthusiastically and with deep emotion embraces all the peoples of america, who in the present and for the future constitute the refuge of christian civilization  the voice of the dominican republic, which is raised, not for the first time, in support of mankind’s endeavor to defend peace based on justice, has a moral right to be heard in these precincts because of the sincerity which has inspired the actions of the dominican people throughout their history in the darkest days of, the war, when the fate of the democracies appeared still uncertain, our country collaborated actively on behalf of the cause of right then being upheld on the battlefield by the peoples who are today sharing in the deliberations of this high assembly, now meeting in an atmosphere of uneasiness  this fact should, however, only spur it on to greater efforts for the benefit of mankind a few hours after the treacherous attack on pearl harbor, the dominican republic, honouring its tradition of law and its international engagements, resolutely went to war to show its solidarity with, and to share the fortunes of, the victim of that hateful aggression, thus taking part at its side in the hazards and responsibilities of the struggle for the defence of freedom of the peoples, and of human dignity  in conformity with this attitude, on the historic occasion of the third meeting of foreign ministers in rio de janeiro, we championed a joint declaration of war by all the american nations against the totalitarian powers  for the sake of continental solidarity, we supported the agreements there adopted, although they were in fact less radical than the position taken up and the views maintained by the people and government of the dominican republic as soon as victory began to dawn on the horizon, victory won at the price of such cruel sacrifices, we devoted all our energies to securing effective collaboration in the efforts at san francisco to produce a world organization worthy of the high destiny of mankind and of civilization once the proposal which brought the united nations into bang had taken final shape, we placed all our reserves of faith and hope in it  we remain loyal to the ideals which inspire it despite the occasional disquieting vicissitudes which sometimes seem to cloud the future of this institution of worldwide importance, and for that reason the future of all mankind it is a source of satisfaction to us that we can now appear in this assembly and furnish the clearest proofs that we have fulfilled all the agreements and recommendations directly or indirectly connected with the mission and activities of the united nations  we have, in fact, ratified the following conventions, for which we have deposited the appropriate instruments with the secretariat: that creating the united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization; that dealing with the privileges and immunities of the united nations; that relating to the constitution of the international refugee organization; that relating to the agreement on interim measures, to be taken in respect of refugees and displaced persons; that referring to the protocol amending the conventions on narcotic drugs; that concerning the world health organization; the agreement on the international monetary fund; the agreement on the international bank for reconstruction and development, and that relating to the constitution of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations to the above list might be added the fulfilment by the dominican republic of other resolutions adopted by the assembly, including all obligations of an economic character, but because of the extreme humanitarian importance of the subject, i wish to make special mention of the contribution which our country has just made to the international children’s emergency fund  when the united nations relief and rehabilitation administration came to an end, the international fund was formed with the noble aim of helping destitute children  the dominican republic, after loyally fulfilling all its obligations to unrra, is now giving its complete collaboration to the new body  it has not only sent a very handsome contribution, but has offered hospitality to thousands of european, children who will now be able to find homes and succour in our country under the protection of the dominican state in such circumstances it is only natural that the dominican republic should take the most lively interest in the subjects on the extensive agenda of this session of the assembly  although this interest applies to each and all of the said subjects, we wish nevertheless to refer to one or two in particular in order to define, from the outset, the position of the dominican government with regard to them first of all we must consider the problem connected with the exercise of the privilege of the veto  as a country belonging to a continent where the principle of the sovereign equality of states is regarded as inviolable, the dominican republic could not view with sympathy the establishment of an exclusive privilege for the great powers; nevertheless, at san francisco we bowed to an expediency which the facts seemed to warrant  now, however, the need to perfect legal systems and adapt them to the great ideals which animate the united nations calls for a reasonable revision of that privilege in order to try to make it better adapted to the fundamental principles underlying the charter, and particularly to that of the juridical equality of states  we entertain the hope that at no distant date this privilege will, disappear entirely; but we feel that, in view of the far from satisfactory results of the use which has been made of it, we must all, here and now, endeavour to secure some regulation of it which will reduce its present disadvantages and adequately restrict its use with regard to palestine, our position was clearly defined at the special session of the assembly which was convened especially for that purpose  after reading the carefully prepared report of the united nations special committee on palestine we are confident that a harmonious and just solution can be reached for the two great peoples, arab and hebrew, whose destinies are linked to that territory  we admire and respect those two noble peoples, whose rights and aspirations are supported by thousands of years of tradition, and, in accordance with our policy of sheltering and protecting all unjustly persecuted groups, we have offered the jews work and a home of their own in our country turning to the treaty of peace with italy, we have associated ourselves with the proposal of the argentine republic that the agenda of this session of the assembly should include discussion of a recommendation that the interested powers be invited to consider revision of that instrument  we were moved to do so out of admiration for the italian people’s achievements in the history of human culture, because of the ties of friendship which link that great country and all the latin nations, and because of the sincerity it has shown in its desire to be associated in the democratic life of today we come, finally, to the special situation in greece  it is evident that the greek people is in the throes of a civil war which, it is alleged, is sustained by the interested assistance the insurgent bands are receiving from neighbouring countries  that being so, intervention by the united nations in this affair is fully justified by the necessity of clarifying the position and lending greece such assistance as circumstances may require for the purpose of freeing it from those foreign elements which are trying to create a state of anarchy there in violation of the respect due to the sovereignty of nations  and if it be asserted that precise evidence is still lacking, we nevertheless feel that it is entirely justifiable for the united nations to carry out a full investigation of such a conflict with a view to adopting appropriate measures in accordance with international practice and with the provisions of the charter which are the foundations of this organization all civil wars which have possible international repercussions not only disturb the internal peace of the country concerned, but endanger the peace of neighbouring areas and consequently jeopardize that of the whole world  we trust that the united nations, by the efficacious use of its resources, will be able to clarify the present dispute in greece and ensure the respect due to the sovereignty of each nation, so that all may live together peaceably in every quarter of the globe there is no doubt about the weight of the responsibility and the immensity of the burden imposed upon this assembly  we are confident, however that the good will of the people who but yesterday united without hesitation in defence of their rights and common ideals, will overcome all obstacles so that the united nations may continue its worldwide work of peace, and that this meeting, which has opened in an atmosphere of general expectancy, may mark a further advance towards the high ideal of human concord  \\ufeffas i am speaking in the general assembly for the first time after having assumed the responsibilities of secretary of state for external affairs of my country, i should like to ask the president of the thirtyfifth session of the assembly to accept the best wishes of the government of the dominican republic, through the delegation over which i have the honour to preside mr  president, we are convinced that, with your wisdom and your dedication to the cause of mankind, which is undoubtedly to save the nations of the organization from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, you will guide our efforts towards the most appropriate solutions to the problems before us, which have even reached the security council i should also like to express to mr  salim ahmed salim our profound appreciation of his praiseworthy efforts during his presidency of the thirtyfourth session and the successive special sessions of the general assembly we are honoured to bid the warmest welcome to the two new members of the organization, the republic of zimbabwe, a nation which has just ended a long and difficult struggle for its independence, and saint vincent and the grenadines, whose participation in the work of the general assembly will enrich the group of latin american states to which it has received a fraternal welcome from the earliest days of its independence, the dominican republic has on numerous occasions demonstrated heroism, courage and devotion to the rule of freedom despite the trials and tribulations to which we have been subjected throughout our history by the vicissitudes of international politics, from which we have been able to emerge with strengthened independence to the extent that it can be said that we are today perhaps one of the few countries in the world that has recovered, without foreign assistance, its status as a sovereign and independent nation, a status that was lost as a result of armed intervention which undermined its republican institutions, but, despite its duration, did not succeed in extinguishing our national spirit consequently, we have absolute faith that the people of the dominican republic has reached such a degree of maturity that the idea of democracy described by abraham lincoln, as government of the people, by the people, and for the people, which has guided it throughout its history is now part of the soul of our nation and is fixed at the core of the defence of our continent we are a peaceloving nation which has survived the sudden reversals of fortune of internal politics over the years  nevertheless we  maintain an unswerving policy of neutrality and nonintervention in the internal affairs of other states as the mainstay of our international relations it is nevertheless surprising that, in the face of adversity, the idea of freedom has survived in our people which, in addition to being subjected to many adverse historical circumstances, has seen various interventions and two major and long totalitarian dictatorships  but the sons of the nation of the dominican republic have preserved in their life as citizens this universal ethical value that is freedom, whose deep roots have never ceased to be nourished by the ideals of the selfless and courageous men who in fought long and hard to found the dominican republic we can be proud that for our country freedom means also the rule of law, the inherent right of men, all men without discrimination  human rights are firmly guaranteed by our institutions  all have the right to godgiven bread, in security and dignity  the solidarity of societies and respect for the dignity of men and nations; solidarity in the constant struggle against barbarity and organized cruelty; and, above all, the constant struggle for justice within a pure and simple democracy, without limitation—these constitute the legacy of the divinity within this broad context of freedom, there exist all the many responsibilities that have been assumed by the present government of the dominican republic—but it cannot be denied that ever since the end of the last dictatorship, which lasted for years until  our nation has been shaped and influenced by those dictatorial policies and a civil war, in an intermediate period which preceded the normality prevailing today in contrast, we have now moved towards the rule of law and the mobilization of our citizens to foster the exploitation of all the resources of our country, notwithstanding the hurricanes which struck in and more recently, hurricane allen we have come a long way in that direction and we are now laying the foundations for a new agararian policy  we are mobilizing all available resources to speed up development, which should lead to greater economic and financial stability we are also expanding international relations with a new vision of closer relations with other nations and a more practical approach to problems, characterized by the signature of bilateral instruments, as is to be expected of a modern society  we are promoting common interests, open markets, reasonable terms to foster joint investments and other similar programmes which should contribute to a better use of labour and the reduction of unemployment in both urban and rural areas furthermore, we are making progress in the communication media, and this is necessary to achieve a bloodless labour revolution, individual security and freedom of the press and all means of expression of thought which is so unlimited that it can appear at times to be excessive, and this is easy to understand when one has experienced limitations on such rights during abnormal periods in the past during the past two years of our new government, we have also become convinced that new trends in international affairs require that states not be bound by the glories of the past or wallow in sterile resentment over negative historical events  only by meeting that requirement can unprofitable isolation be avoided  progress must be sought in the opposite direction, by endeavouring to promote international relations of a kind that can open the way to understanding, solidarity and peace among nations with this new opening up of our international policies, the government of the dominican republic has entered a new period of its history in which it has realistic friendly relations with the republic of haiti, a neighbour of ours with whom we share—perhaps uniquely in the world— dominion over one island encouraged by these new ideas, the island policy that we now have with our sister country has been strengthened with every passing day, and this has created new opportunities for cultural, social and economic exchanges which we hope will lead to the signing of constructive instruments  this will surely lead to the creation of markets more in keeping with the realities of our situation and will provide better opportunities for the achievement of our mutual goals within this economic and commercial pattern, a very promising convention on trade between the two countries has been signed  it includes a freetrade zone which applies to products produced in each country, and many facilities will ensue from that  we have scheduled reductions of import taxes on products which are specifically defined in the first and second lists annexed to that convention  under the same instrument a permanent commission is established to determine which products will be the subject of negotiations, to propose lists of selected products, and to change the schedule for customs reductions  all this is marked by reasonable flexibility no less important is the convention on land transportation, which is to guarantee permanent communications between the supply centres and the consumption centres, and this covers products which are used in trade and is intended to promote friendship among fraternal countries in the spirit of international cooperation a new page in the history of our countries began on may  when antonio guzman and jeanclaude duvalier embraced each other for the first time in jimani malpasse  from that time on our two nations realized that there was nothing to fear and that a new era was dawning— just as another era ended years ago—and it is an era without heroes perhaps but one also without martyrs ever since the first nonindigenous settlers on both sides of the island began to fight for dominion over the island, our peoples had lived in only one of three ways: confronting each other, with their backs turned to each other or on top of each other  that was until the arrival of antonio guzman and jeanclaude duvalier  now our two peoples, under the leadership of these two statesmen, have begun a new life: a life of friendship, good will and cooperation, to quote the words, the firm intentions expressed by antonio guzman when he welcomed jeanclaude duvalier, the president of haiti, at jimanimalpasse friendship, good will and cooperation are the abc of the foreign policy of president guzman with regard to haiti and that of president duvalier with regard to the dominican republic  instead of confrontation, instead of hostile indifference, there is today, along with a firm desire to work, a determination to live in peace as blood brothers these are glad tidings that i bring to the assembly  the dominican republic is no longer an enemy of haiti, and haiti has ceased to be an enemy of the dominican republic  if we look at the truth, our peoples have never truly been enemies  those who have been enemies have been a few of the men that have led our peoples  while the powerful of yesterday chose war, those in power today have chosen peace  the gloom that marked relations between the two countries has been replaced by a ray of light  between the two nations today not only do we have peace, tranquillity and good understanding, but the future is bright this great reunion shows that there is no reason for peoples to commit aggression or to destroy themselves in war over problems which could be resolved in a civilized manner  now with firm steps—although they are often slow ones because of the precariousness of our resources—we are waging an allout battle against the common enemy of our peoples, the implacable adversary of the developing countries: poverty  it is poverty that prevents us from developing spiritually, politically, economically and socially in human dignity we have made these references to our relations with the haitian people and government, one of the aspects of our present policy, which is in keeping with the international norms which the charter of the united nations advocates within the philosophy of peace keeping, which more than ever requires a concerted solution to disputes and conflicts, in which dialogue must be prominent  it is the best and most effective way in which states can deal with each other in this decade in this context, progress has been made, but backward steps also have been taken  now there is more reason than ever before to act positively, for international terrorism in many forms has been the source of disturbance and has undermined international public order, creating an alarming situation; that phenomenon increasingly is at variance with human rights, which must prevail if we are aware of the implications of a nuclear war—which could be caused by an unbridled arms race—when terrifying weapons of destruction are used which push the outlook for peace further away in our uncertain future it is certainly disturbing—for those reasons—that terrorism, far from being in decline, is gaining ground in certain very sensitive areas  for various sociological reasons, it has been more intense  hence, we must be alert  states must stand together in a common effort to end this violence wherever it may rear its ugly head and create a threat to the states themselves in the past few years international terrorism has taken on a particularly heinous form  my delegation is referring to seizures for the purpose of economic exploitation  frequently the pretext used is the fight for freedom, but that is often not the true purpose  it is mere lust for money  this is an international crime which cannot be justified and cannot remain unpunished my country has been tested by such events  they represent a return to savagery which smacks of medieval obscurantism and constitute a challenge and a threat to our country and our institutions we have ourselves suffered the unfortunate experience of that form of terrorism that uses as weapons the seizure and holding of hostages, who are the innocent and the defenceless victims of that wanton crime fortunately, our national dignity has remained unscathed by such trials and we have emerged from them without bloodshed  such would not have been the case had common sense and providence not intervened in a timely manner we cannot fail to condemn the repugnant spectacle of human beings held in long captivity in iran simply because they belong to an institution which is hundreds of years old, the institution of diplomacy that makes possible legal relations among states and without which the world would be uninhabitable international instruments that punish and prevent such crimes have been referred to here in the general assembly  a few years ago, when aircraft were being seized and their passengers exposed to risks, the dominican republic and brazil agreed that such criminal acts must be considered as transgressions of juris gentium because preventive action is difficult when we speak of international terrorism in all its forms as a scourge, we cannot fail also to advocate the elimination of certain legal excesses in which states have engaged in order to repress, exceeding the limits of domestic law and affect the rights of others  in that line of thought, our delegation shares the view of those who believe that human rights are absolute  this is not open to challenge; it is enshrined in international law  one of the great achievements of our time is that such rights are a part of juris gentium and they have become part of that law because violations of human rights can lead to conflicts for these reasons, the dominican republic also advocates the abolition of capital punishment  this must become a norm of law in the universal declaration of human rights and a basic principle in the american convention on that subject   although this form of punishment is generally proscribed, it is permitted exceptionally in those states in which it had existed before the signing of the interamerican instrument  logic, since the days of the greeks, has taught us that things cannot be and not be at the same time we are pleased to say that the constitution of our country sets forth in one of its tenets what must one day appear in all international instruments on human rights  it states the following under that heading:the inviolability of life as a result, there must be no capital punishment, no torture nor any other penalty or procedure implying the loss or diminution of physical integrity or individual wellbeing this idea underlies the observations the dominican republic made concerning the american convention on human rights the dominican republic, as it signs the american convention on human rights, hopes to see the death penalty banned and that principle applied generally in the states of the american region, and we hereby reiterate the observations and comments made with regard to the draft convention and circulated among the delegations of the council of the organization of american states on june in this area of human rights, our country, despite our untoward experiences in the past both under dictatorship and at other times, has achieved positive goals and will continue to work towards the rule of law these considerations would be incomplete were we to fail to recognize that those countries that are still grappling with problems that arise from an insufficient degree of development owing to insufficient economic means must promote education, without which democracy cannot survive  the five freedoms proclaimed in the pacific region must become a reality  if this is so, we must recognize that the industrialized, fully developed countries, which makeup the established economic institutions, are in duty bound to come to the economic, technological, social and cultural assistance of the developing countries this recalls the declaration of algiers   we would add that this must be a commitment, not merely an expression of charity or pity  it is an unchallenged fact that today the economic ills of one state have an inevitable effect on others the thirtyfifth session of the general assembly coincides with the beginning of a new decade, and this has a very special significance for the international economic order  it is particularly significant for the third world countries that are not oil producers, like the dominican republic, countries whose governments are engaged in an allout battle against poverty in all its forms and are endeavouring to establish a society ruled by social justice and a broader and more equitable distribution of material goods, as well as to promote the enjoyment of the spiritual values so essential to human dignity and representative democracy only a few weeks ago, the eleventh special session of the general assembly was held to consider an international strategy for development; it is to be hoped that its conclusions will be supported by the industrialized countries, including the united states of america, japan and the european countries  the results of those deliberations will continue to be considered in relation to general rules as well as to the global negotiations so that we may actually begin the implementation of the international development strategy for the third united nations development decade the countries of the third world base their demands on the fact that the world distribution of income is very unequal and that internal efforts to improve development levels are being obstructed at the international level and are meeting external forces to minimize them  this can clearly be seen in international trade relations  the need for reform goes far beyond the liberalization achieved by the negotiations within gatt  the quota system, systems of safeguards and various forms of restrictions that affect the export of many products from developing to industrialized countries all contribute to this inequality in income distribution throughout the world and have made it impossible to establish a fair level for prices through trade machinery the industrialized countries must unhesitatingly recognize that the stabilization of commodity prices represents a reform that will help them as much as the less developed countries  for this reason, the common fund for commodities, as well as the creation of a reserve fund for food grains, will benefit not only the producing but also the consumer countries through a more rational use of resources and the promotion of larger investments the violent fluctuations in the price of sugar on the world market is a striking example of the enormous difficulties which periodically beset the economies of countries like the dominican republic  these ups and downs create uncertainties  the international sugar agreement is an instrument filled with good intentions, but its effectiveness leaves much to be desired because price adjustments are not as automatic as one would wish and prices are fixed on the basis of supply, if not by speculation  in the circumstances, our economy, which depends largely on sugar exports, is in a particularly precarious state, which makes it impossible to plan resources  world inflation is making the situation even worse consequently, it is not surprising that refinancing of the external debt looms large in the thinking of the third world countries  while it is difficult to assess the benefits refinancing would bring, it would certainly have a stabilizing effect on the financial markets and make it easier for the debtor countries to adapt'  the external debt of developing countries that do not export oil has increased from $billion in to $billion in  and in countries of latin america alone the debt went from $billion to $billion during that same period  as the external debt increases considerably, there has been, at the same time, a large rise in private loans and a consequent reduction of official loans; higher interest rates and shorter repayment periods thus have resulted  the industrialized countries must give assistance here to the developing countries in the form of donations and loans on easy terms and with fewer conditions international cooperation for development must be extended to other areas of importance such as industrialization, the transfer of science and technology and the more rational use of natural resources, the expansion of agricultural production and the promotion of food production, as well as the protection of the environment however, if all these negotiations concerning the international economic outlook are to be productive, it is necessary for the highly industrialized countries to resolve their problems of inflation and the low growth rate of their gross national product  the less developed countries must react to the hostility of the international economic environment— which is marked by protectionist tendencies and increases in the price of petroleum—and the difficulties regarding foreign trade and growing external debts, with all the problems that that implies  for our country, the value of our oil imports this year will amount to $million; that is, $million more than it was in  as a result of the fact that the average price of a barrel of oil rose from $to $ although consumption remained the same as during the previous year the cost of payment and repayment of our debts in is estimated at $million  therefore, those two areas alone will absorb approximately percent of our total export earnings, which are estimated at $million the government of our country, under president antonio guzman, in only two years has implemented an economic programme aimed at changing our development pattern and providing incentives for agricultural and livestock development on the basis of agricultural and industrial promotion  our import substitution programme is expected to increase along with the production and use of our national raw materials and laws that provide incentives for exportation we have tried to improve our public finances, eliminate luxury investments and above all concentrate on expanding education, health services, agricultural credits, dynamic agrarian reform, the building of secondary roads and the training of businessmen, in small and mediumsized concerns  we are developing our infrastructure through the construction of highways, irrigation channels and dams and energy development; we are endeavouring to expand promotion of the agricultural sector but an accelerated rate of implementation has been difficult owing precisely to our problems of balance of payment and foreign debt recent statistics have been given by the united nations and the world bank showing that during the first years of the present decade billion people—half the people of the world—will suffer from gastrointestinal disease because the water they drink is contaminated  yet $million is being spent every minute on weapons for war many countries destroy food surpluses in order to keep prices high while, at the same time, four fifths of mankind is suffering from hunger and malnutrition, and does not have the basic domestic appliances to make life bearable i should like to repeat here what so many others have said here and in other forums, namely, that the enemy of peace, the one truly responsible for human misery, fanning the fire of revolution, is injustice in the broadest sense of the word, which is the abuse of authority and the exploitation of man by man  in international relations there are vastly different standards for judging others from the standards which we use to judge ourselves william bowdler, undersecretary for interamerican affairs in the subcommittee on interamerican affairs, speaking before the foreign relations committee of the house of representatives, reflected the thoughts of morgen thau when he said: the real question confronting the foreign policy of the united states     is not how to preserve stability in the face of the revolutionary process but rather how to create stability as a result of revolution in my country development has been slow but it has been inexorable as the result of a genuine revolution which has gone through stages  it is a revolution through evolution  we have a government that respects human rights  there are no limitations to free expression, except those imposed by law  freedom of movement is a reality  there are no political prisoners  no one is persecuted for his ideas  there are no exiles  no one simply disappears  we have life in a genuine democracy and there is absolute freedom within order  we have therefore created our own stability of which morgenthau spoke  we have done our part regarding what has been confronting the foreign policy of the united states  thus, we have the right—and we have that right to our guaranteed stability when mr  bowdler accepted the change and said it was natural and inevitable, he was merely adjusting his watch in time with history  when he said that peace and democracy in our region require fundamental political and socioeconomic reforms which promote the wellbeing and strengthen the rights of the individual, he was formulating a thesis that his country can help to bring about in reality  change and reform will serve no useful purpose if our countries receive the same unjust treatment that the powerful reserve for subjugated peoples the oil problem, which hangs like a sword over our heads, is a matter that must be dealt with by those who have the good fortune to be oil producers a new vision in our commercial relations has appeared; a new, more modern approach to justice and equity is needed if political experiments which have been translated into reality, as in the dominican republic, have no immediate success, we run the risk that the enemy forces that beset us will sweep us away  there are some demagogues, who affirm that democracy has already performed its historic function and that the path of the vote is the path of suicide,the peoples of the world love freedom so much, men have such an elevated concept of freedom that in my country everyone is very well aware of the precarious state in which we have been left by the forces of nature and by the devastation caused by those who went before us, and now we are working for the full enjoyment of those values of which we have spoken  the people realize with every passing day that the man whom it has chosen to guide its destiny is multiplying his efforts and will never rest until the most humble dominican has been rescued from misery, ignorance and sorrow but the old economic disorder persists and in countries like mine, after centuries of struggle and after the people have succeeded in securing respect for their wishes, now offers us no more than freedom without bread, without adequate housing, without health and without equitable distribution if we are to speak truly of equitable distribution of the wealth of our country, it is necessary for us to speak of equitable distribution of the profits produced by our wealth for the powerful countries we must put an end to the imbalance which exists between the enterprises and those employed by enterprises  once the labour of the workers ceases to be a mere input in large landholdings and in industry to acquire the status that it has in certain powerful countries, then can we speak of respect for human rights, of dignity for human beings without equality there can be no fraternity, no good will  without justice man enthusiasm and the enthusiasm of peoples for solidarity in moments of misfortune and rejoicing in times of triumph will not be aroused aristotle said, nearly four centuries before the birth of christ, that inequality is always the cause of revolutions  and according to the same philosopher there is inequality when those who are the victims of revolutions are not compensated but there is also inequality when, among those who contribute to the exploitation of wealth, there exists a great difference in the distribution of that wealth  there is inequality when the greatest wealth of a country is acquired by someone else for speculative purposes and when the true owners of the riches are left in a state of poverty  there is inequality when what is paid in terms of interest is greater than what is received in terms of loans  there will be inequality as long as our tourists are not given the treatment they deserve and as long as our citizens are not treated as masters in their own homes we need a vigorous energy policy such as has been launched by our president in the face of the oil crisis  for this reason studies have already begun on turning our oil burning thermoelectric plants over to coal; research work has been started on the drying of cane pulp by solar energy to increase power capacity; we are carrying out feasibility studies on the building of a megawatt electrical plant, also using solar energy; and we have intensified the search for oil in various parts of the country, and among other important studies, we are developing hydraulic energy all these efforts are designed to promote a more just and equitable society, where political democracy is based on social justice, equal opportunity and the elimination of differences between the poor and the rich  this is the greatest contribution that our country can make to the new international economic order and, in particular, to solving the problems of the caribbean, which traditionally has been the scene of abrupt political change we should like to make a few comments regarding the situation in the middle east, which is a highly sensitive area of conflict  in recent months the picture in that area has become even more gloomy as a member of our world organization, the dominican republic took part in the deliberations which led to the creation of the state of israel  the basis of that historic act was the principle in the charter on the selfdetermination of peoples  we share the view that creation of that nation was based on international law  we never failed to recognize all that the holy scriptures grant the people of israel as a participant in the interamerican conference on the problems of war and peace, held at mexico city in when the allied powers saw the end of the second world war approaching and the spirit of the yalta agreements inspired the international community re dominican republic was anxious to support new visions of a more peaceful world this spirit also prevailed at the san francisco conference and in the debates which led to the signing of the charter of the united nations, which for so many years has prevented the scourge of total war and helped to preserve peace therefore, when considering the right of israel to survive as a sovereign state established in accordance with the principle of the selfdetermination of peoples, we cannot but honour the commitment imposed by the principles of the charter for those reasons, we have lent our reasonable support to israel whenever the legitimacy of that state has been challenged  for the same reasons, our country recognizes the right of the palestinian people, without diminishing the right to existence of a people which, like israel, has participated in the great work of peace we think that this is a just and legitimate position and we consider that peaceful means should be used to settle the situation in the middle east  with equal conviction we view the camp david agreements as a firm step towards peace in the middle east, in an atmosphere of tranquillity and mutual respect and under the rule of law  in this way the states involved can live within permanent, secure and guaranteed borders the dominican republic, which has survived the vicissitudes of history and has always observed a policy of neutrality, believes that this is the right policy for small countries, especially developing countries, within the framework of independent sovereign democracy  thus we cannot fail to mention afghanistan, which is a member state of the third world movement to which we belong because we cherish peace, we deplore the abnormal situation which has occurred there in violation of the fundamental norms of international law and the demands of peace which justify the existence of the united nations  consequently we believe that the situation in afghanistan must return to the status quo ante, and by peaceful means for the same reasons, which are in keeping with the universal principles of the free nations of the world, the government of the dominican republic hopes that the machinery available to the organization will make it possible to stop the conflict between the neighbouring countries of iran and iraq, countries with the maturity of many centuries of experience, in order to prevent the outbreak of a total war we say this in a spirit of the strictest neutrality let me sum up by saying that in respect for human rights and for the organization we have an obligation to build a more just world in peace  this is what was said by his holiness pope john paul ii in santo domingo, the oldest capital in the americas:we must see to it that there are no children who are without sufficient nutrition, without education or training; we must ensure that there are no young people who lack suitable training, that there are no peasants without land and unable to live in dignity; we must see to it that workers are not mistreated, that their rights are not violated; we must see to it that there are no systems allowing the exploitation of man by man, or by the state; there must be no corruption; there must be none who through no fault of their own have nothing while others enjoy superabundance; there must be no broken, disunited, insufficiently caredfor families; no one must be without the protection of the law; the law must protect everyone equally; force must not prevail over truth and law, but truth and law must prevail over force; we must ensure that economic and political considerations never prevail over humanitarian considerations  \\ufeffit is a great honour and pleasure for me to return to this rostrum for the fortyfourth session of the assembly and to address it on behalf of my country, the dominican republic it is also a matter of great satisfaction to me to convey to mr  joseph nanven garba the warm congratulations of the dominican government, and of our delegation in particular, on his welldeserved election to the presidency of this great gathering  i look forward confidently to his complete success in this sensitive undertaking inasmuch as he is a skilled and seasoned diplomat from a region which is undergoing a steady process of growth and development  a fact that can be observed in the importance and the scope of the convention concluded between the european economic community and the african, caribbean aid pacific states, better known as the lome convention, the progress of which we have been following in our country with much interest and with a great feeling of solidarity  his outstanding personal qualities will ensure that the work and the deliberations of this session will be guided with due deliberation and the highest aims  in this respect, he can count on our resolute cooperation this is a suitable opportunity to express our high esteem for that outstanding argentine internationalist, mr, dante caputo, for his exemplary guidance of the work of the last session on this solemn occasion we should like to place on record our great appreciation and admiration for the secretarygeneral of our organization, mr  javier perez de cuellar, for the valuable, timely and unstinting work that he has been doing to promote peace and understanding among the peoples and nations of the earth at the beginning of my statement i should like to thank the representatives for their attention to lay sincere message of goodwill from a part of the globe that has been called upon to play a major role from the time of the arrival in the new world of the visionary, the admiral of the seas christopher columbus, a portentous event that changed the course of history hispaniola has had the honour of having its capital santo domingo, as the headquarters of the first administrative, religious, cultural, scientific and economic institutions of the american continent fran this confluence of cultures, ethnic groups, customs and traditions on hispaniola, the first voices were raised in defence of the indigenous races, which formed a new and juridical concept of equality and justice among human beings, through jus gentium, the law of nations, in which one can find the true roots of modern international law, and as a result, the distant origins of the international bodies designed to ensure the observance and effectiveness of the inherent rights of the human person under that auspicious beacon, in this lofty body in which all the nations of the world are represented with their own particular characteristics, we are again meeting in a yearly pilgrimage to find peace  but this ideal, which is so difficult to express in specific terms, cannot be fully achieved unless it is by means of open and respectful, but firm and conclusive, dialogue, with a view to putting an end to terrorism and drug trafficking, in whatever form or under any pretext it is natural that any undertaking directed towards limiting the arms race and eliminating deadly weapons should be seen as a comforting and encouraging example  that is the case with respect to the agreement on the limitation of strategic weapons between the united states and the soviet union, which was jointly announced by secretary of state james baker and minister for foreign affairs eduard shevardnadze  special mention should be made of the plan proposed at this session of the general assembly by the president of the united states, mr  george bush, to rid the earth of the scourge of chemical weapons, a proposal that was welcomed by the soviet union  these positive steps, which demonstrate the will of both superpowers to reduce the causes of tension and disagreement, will have a favourable impact on world politics in the coming years once again, i should like to recall that the dominican republic, a caribbean nation, is aware that its development is indissolubly linked to that of our neighbour, haiti, and of the other countries of the area  our trade with those countries had been minimal despite the geographic,, ethnic, historic and economic bonds that unite us  hence our government has begun an energetic movement towards integration with our caribbean brothers, since we are fully convinced that it is only by means of joint, united efforts that we shall achieve the goals that will bring us full development for our peoples with regard to the tragic situation in central america, our country reiterates that it is interested in cooperating in the search for a speedy and most fitting solution of this conflict  we categorically support the agreements that have been entered into in the search for peace by the five central american presidents – the esquipulas ii agreements and the playa del tesoro declarations  aimed at achieving a peaceful negotiated solution to the central american crisis  the recent tela presidential summit demonstrates that there is hope that peace can be achieved, for peace is the essential prerequisite for the solution of the political, economic and social problems of the region the dominican republic has noted with particular interest the events occurring throughout africa, not only because of its impact on international policies, but also because the african race is part of our own ethnic and cultural substratum  we stand in solidarity with the african peoples and participate in efforts to solve their problems, which are similar to those facing all developing countries  the situation in southern africa continues to be explosive, with unforeseeable consequences for peace and security in the area; its prolongation has an impact on international stability security council resolution ( contains the basic elements for a just and lasting solution of the question of namibia  for almost years the south african apartheid regime has been illegally occupying the territory, in defiance of all the relevant united nations resolutions  we defend namibia fundamental right to selfdetermination  the delegation of the dominican republic believes that the system of government in south african breeds violence, injustice, oppression, inequality and discrimination  in other words, everything that flies in the face of the ideals behind the founding of the united nations  the eradication of apartheid and independence for namibia will create the necessary conditions for a return to peace in southern africa  we call for the cessation of the growing hostilities between syrian forces and lebanese christian soldiers  despite this escalation, the efforts for peace that have begun recently give us hope for a definitive solution of the conflict the situation in the middle east, which is of great concern to all nations of the world, has a direct impact on dominicans, because among our ethnic groups there are many people with palestinian, syrian, arab and israeli roots, with the resultant influence they bring to our national life the dominican republic has been concerned for several years about the situation in the korean peninsula  our country has supported the view that korean affairs must be solved peacefully by means of dialogue between the two koreas  the republic of korea must be admitted to membership in the united nations in keeping with the principle of universality  its entry into the organization would contribute to reducing tension and promoting peace in northeastern asia  the dominican republic has viewed favourably the formula for the unification of the korean community that was proposed recently by the government of the republic of korea to promote peaceful coexistence between the south and the north of korea the serious and tragic situation in many developing nations makes it imperative for us urgently to adopt effective and concrete measures to improve the living conditions of millions in the third world  the presence in this important gathering of a growing number of heads of state or government from those countries is clear proof of the worldwide interest and expectations regarding the results and conclusions of this session, which has also brought together representatives of the most powerful and developed countries of the world the situation of the nations of the third world is so critical and paradoxical that their economies are constantly stagnating or actually deteriorating  there will be no improvement until more favourable conditions are provided for access by our export products to the developed countries' markets  if that goal is achieved, and if the developing countries receive better treatment in negotiations regarding their external debt from the creditor nations and entities, we shall have an opportunity, with the impetus of this necessary cooperation, to embark energetically and optimistically upon the path of our development thus, it is obvious that the solution to the general problem of the external debt cannot be achieved with the ways and means that have been used to date, since in most cases they do not allow for economic growth and therefore subject peoples to impoverishment and social upheaval the international community, aware of the intricate nature of this problem, which is not merely economic in nature, recognizes that the united nations has the competence to seek a solution in the political sphere the position of the dominican republic was defined graphically by his excellency mr  joaquin balaguer, the president of the dominican republic, in his speech at the opening meeting of the twelfth annual conference on investment, trade and development, held in miami, in the united states, in november of  he said: the goal set forth in berlin for the thirdworld countries is not to pay the public debt but, above all, to achieve sustained economic growth and an increase in percapita income that will guarantee our dispossessed masses the right to eat, to clothe themselves, to educate their children and to live under a decent roof  in other words, the thirdworld countries face two challenges  not one, as was said in berlin  the first is to live; the second, to pay since terrorism continues to affect all nations to such a degree and with such tragic and disastrous consequences, sowing fear and insecurity, a strong, internationally coordinated plan must be adopted to combat it more firmly and thereby ensure its eradication  one of the most criminal and frequent forms of terrorist action is the attacks against passengers, flights and airports  such attacks are increasingly stirring the universal conscience the dominican republic strongly condemns the subversive activities of international terrorism, which is carried out indiscriminately against mothers, innocent children and the ill  in other words, against life itself, the most precious thing we own the alarming problem of drugs has reached such dimensions, it terms both of production and of trade and consumption, that our delegation wishes to place it on record that the dominican government is struggling with all the means in its power to deal with this social evil that is spreading like a flood  for that purpose our courts have been imposing increasingly severe sentences on drug traffickers  publicity has been given to this throughout the country with a view to ensuring that drug users and traffickers are aware of it and that people understand the evil and disastrous consequences of this illegal trade we also give our moral support to the battle which is being waged by countries throughout the continent and whose development we are following with great interest at this difficult historical time of conflict, with acute, burning problems that i have mentioned in this statement  to which my colleagues in the assembly have been good enough to listen with attention  there have been signs of detente and an improvement in international relations above and beyond diverse criticism or positions  i should like to express on behalf of the government that i have the honour of representing and on my own behalf, our fervent desire to see concrete form given to the ideals and principles that led to the establishment of the world organization, in which mankind has placed its hopes for a better future in which the ethical and spiritual values that underlie our civilization prevail   all the americas welcome with pride and enthusiasm the honour which this distinguished assembly has just conferred on one of the american continent’s most illustrious sons, mr  emilio arenales, minister for foreign affairs of guatemala, by electing him its president for the twentythird session  on this great occasion i am happy to convey the homage and goodwill of the government and people of the dominican republic, and their sincere affection, to one who in bringing honour to his own country also enhances the prestige of his fellows of the americas   mr  emilio arenales is a statesman of firmly democratic persuasion and deep moral convictions; an ardent believer in the ideal of justice proclaimed by the united nations  there can be no doubt that under his able guidance the twentythird session of the general assembly will achieve substantial successes adding to the stature of the international community, which finds its highest expression in this assembly  we pray fervently and with reverent humility that by the grace of god, our president may be enabled fully to meet the enormous responsibilities we have placed upon his learning, his wisdom, his poise and his prudence   i am quite sure that not only our president, but all of us who are assembled here and in some degree symbolize the aspirations of millions of human beings need the guiding light of god’s providence; for this twentythird session of the general assembly is beginning its work in a disquieting atmosphere of political unrest mainly deriving from dangerous backgrounds of economic and social frustration  there is nothing easy in the task which faces us, but the difficulties must nevertheless be overcome  we must direct our efforts towards that allimportant end even though we are bound to give warning that noone must expect us to produce a miraculous potion capable of curing forthwith all the material and spiritual ills afflicting the less fortunate peoples and individuals  however, we are fully aware that, while there are no magic formulae for more effectively helping the needy, there is no justification, either, for indolence or any failure to meet responsibility on the part of those of us whose solemn duty it is to raise aloft and to defend the banner of justice  the government and people of the dominican republic, responsive to the dictates of conscience, have therefore sent their representatives to attend the twentythird session of the general assembly in the most vehement desire to help to find solutions leading towards worldwide concord founded upon the legitimate right to subsistence and on the mutual respect that must prevail between men and between nations  this lofty aim of concord is surely of the essence of both multinational and of strictly and exclusively national endeavour  at all events, it is reasonable to assert that world peace, founded on the right to subsistence begins and finds its most dramatic expression specifically at the national level  this means that in the long run the concord we so painstakingly seek through centres of international discussion must necessarily proceed from what we are individually able to do in this respect within our own local borders   this is one of the bases in which the policy of the constitutional government of the dominican republic is anchored  we very firmly believe that we contribute to the attainment of mankind’s highest aims to the extent to which we are able to promote justice in all its manifold forms within our own frontiers  starting from this premise, i can state emphatically that in the dominican republic, a country which in recent years has repeatedly suffered the blows of fate, a process of change at depth has begun that is inspired precisely by the ideal which imbues the thinking of this august assembly  all the machinery of my country’s government is deeply involved in this endeavour under the guidance of the head of state, his excellency mr  joaquín balaguer, a man whose outstanding moral qualities are recognized even by his political opponents  his personal capacities, together with his acknowledged intellectual ability and his keen sense of social values, are the human qualities underlying the implementation of a policy of rehabilitation and betterment in a community in whose least conspicuous strata there are restless stirrings and the germs of political strife proliferate  this national effort is our contribution to peace  we come to this austere meetingplace with a message of brotherhood and positive willingness to understand, for the purpose of calmly and impartially weighing the vital problems which the agenda places before us for consideration  but we must acknowledge that we are deeply concerned at the continued existence in various parts of the world of focal points of conflict and areas of tension which may burst into flame at any moment and none of which it has been found possible to eliminate or reduce since the previous—last year’s—session of this assembly  nevertheless, we are even more concerned and disturbed to note that in addition to our having made only very slow progress towards the political problems which confronted us last year, the power of violence has in recent times reverted to its most primitive form of expression in violation of law  we deeply deplore the offences committed against the international rule of law  world society now possesses legal instruments which very firmly proscribe unilateral action  the united nations system, with its charter that is law for all member states, is precisely the machinery through which disputes liable to disturb international peace should be adjusted, and is also the altar to which all states must bow before undertaking any unilateral action endangering or menacing the peace of nations  i do not need to enumerate for purposes of casuistry the discouraging examples that distress those of us who are convinced and active advocates of a system in which peace prevails in a relationship of justice  we should merely like to recall that the fact that we have subscribed to the fundamental principles of united nations as a means of settling relationships among states places us under an ineluctable duty to be faithful servants of law as well  it is for this reason that the government and people of the dominican republic do not wish to point an accusing finger at anyone, but wish to exhort all governments and peoples here represented to join with us in an act of firm and sincere dedication to strengthening the pillars which sustain our organization  let us not, like hercules, unleash the forces of unreason to weaken those pillars, for if we do so we shall all, without exception, run the risk of being crushed under the weight of moral and material collapse  international peace is the supreme purpose of the united nations, but the united nations itself is the sum of the political wills of all the individual states  my government strongly supports the conciliatory efforts now proceeding in certain parts of the world; in particular it supports the mission of ambassador jarring, special representative of the secretarygeneral of the united nations, in pursuance of security council resolution ( of november  which calls upon the parties in dispute to negotiate  we cannot conceal the concern with which we view the worsening of the situation in the middle east  in the same way we think it a great pity that so wellmeaning an initiative as that recently taken by president johnson in the matter of the conflict in vietnam should not yet have achieved the result for which the free world was hoping  i am convinced by the teachings of history that behind the great dissensions between men and between nations there is always within reach, if the parties seek justice, a way to find an honourable solution to the most difficult problems and i therefore trust that the official talks in paris between the united states and north vietnam will not disappoint the hopes that have been placed in this important step towards the achievement ofworld peace  it is disheartening to note that the past year has produced no favourable changes in connexion with the situation in southern rhodesia  my government therefore maintains the views on this subject which it expressed during the twentysecond session of the general assembly h meeting, in  i said earlier that i bring to this assembly a message of brotherhood from the government and people of the dominican republic  before concluding, i wish to convey to the delegations here present cordial greetings from the delegation of the dominican republic, the chairman of which delegation i have the honour to be  in particular, i should like to express to the delegation of the republic of china my sincere thanks for the kindnesses shown to me by the high authorities of that country when i paid an official visit to formosa in may of this year  small countries like mine, which cannot use the language of force to ensure respect for their national integrity and their right to work out their destiny in accordance with democratic principles and the ideals upheld by the free countries of the world, have no means of asserting their international legal personality other than the vast field of high moral strategy of “consensual right, the ultimate basis of relations among states  in saying this i am not thinking only of the inflamed condition of today’s international political scene, but much more of the fact borne out by history, that rights trampled on with impunity lead to further, more profound and more dangerous violations liable to affect us all  accordingly, although the repudiation of the civilized nations of the world is implicit, i feel bound, because my sense of justice has been offended, to include in these general considerations the feelings so summarized, of the dominican people when faced with the anomalous situation recently created in czechoslovakia    mr  president, in the name of brotherhood, for which the dominican republic is striving, and on behalf of the government of my country, which is honored to be one of the founding members of the united nations, allow me to express to you our congratulations on your being elected to the presidency of the general assembly, which we trust you will direct with your wellknown wisdom, which has earned you a reputation as a statesman and as one who is respectful of the principles of our organization, which provides protection for all men and peoples under the provisions of our charter  we are confident that, guided by your knowledge and by the prestige which you will impart to our debates and deliberations, the twentysixth session of the general assembly will have special historic significance, because here we will achieve the progress which has long been anxiously awaited and we feel sure that we will take one more step towards the rule of law for which we are all, as member states, equally responsible on this happy occasion, allow me also to express our best wishes for the success of this important session, and at the same time i should like to extend a hearty welcome to the new states of bahrain, bhutan and qatar, which have come to swell the membership of this universal organization finally, my country wishes to pay a wellearned tribute to secretarygeneral u thant for his outstanding work in the lofty post which he now holds we, the representatives who have gathered together here at the twentysixth session, are filled with concern over those matters which were not resolved at the past sessions  now we are equipped with the means and instruments provided by the united nations system, which should make it possible for us to meet the needs of the international community understandably enough, many of the issues which have been held over without any progress having been made are such as to require that we overcome considerable difficulties, though these matters deserve priority and they are problems which require judicious compromise and the reconciliation of divergent ideas and the passing of time, although we must not act at variance with principles or in violation of the rules of law to which we owe our respect it is impossible really to disregard presentday realities, because no rule of law can on its own first lay the groundwork and then achieve the victory which we so ardently desire; for human justice is imperfect, like all the works of man, but it is capable of bringing about confidence and assurance among men and nations towards the middle of our century, scarcely five years after the organization was founded in san francisco, an invisible divisive factor emerged which was sufficiently powerful to impede progress towards the objectives of the charter  i am referring to the international tension which at that time began to increase to such an extent that we can now say that we are all men and peoples caught in its web  so it was that we entered what has come to be called the cold war, of which the members of this world organization have not been able to rid themselves  it is neither difficult to recognize this phenomenon nor easy to control it, for it has so frequently come to hold sway and has even at times caused us to question the utility of our organization, which is in fact a forum where all the nations of the world may come together to resolve their difficulties  at least, that is what our organization should be, but the truth is that we wish to achieve perfection, when the human mind cannot fully comprehend what perfection is  we wish to create a perfect society, whereas human perfection does not exist; and, because it does not exist, we rebel and inevitably we yield to the tensions which now beset us  the end result is really only those negative factors which we wished to avoid by creating our organization and by fulfilling the commitments which we entered into when we became members of our organization  this is the agony of our time it is for this reason that on the limited horizons of men and nations has arisen the specter of war and of revolutions which seem capable of creating a new world; but we seem to have forgotten that we are living in the best of all possible worlds and that the real crisis is that we must reshape our world and bring it into hue with the needs of communities and other changes which have affected most of the things in which we placed our trust when we were as yet uninfluenced by the new forces and pressures which have been the inevitable result of progress and the advancement of civilization with the unbridled development of technology, whose visage may yet appear hideous, man has conquered space, and he has also simply been able to survive, to progress and change things but he has at the same time created voids which, it seems, he may not be able to fill in the midst o' the agony and confusion which surrounds us we are tempted at times to blame the world for the ills of mankind  but we should not forget that mankind is man; and man goes on, for without man, with all his virtues and all his shortcomings, there can exist no communities or peoples,the states members of this organization which came into existence as a result of the complex event of victory were confident that it would be able to resolve all the problems of the family of nations, all the crises, all the demands, all the quarrels  however, this shift in responsibility has given rise to disillusionment, whereas in reality only an insignificant period of time has elapsed  we have entered a period of crisis in law, which is constantly being forged so as to keep pace with events which occur at the same speed that classical ideas which we clung to for many centuries have evolved new ways out of this crisis must be found and new changes in law and international politics must be made, so that the united nations may be given the necessary instruments, after years of existence, to discharge more effectively its mandate to maintain peace and preserve mankind from the scourge of war but nothing can be achieved in this direction if we in this organization stand in the way of change, which is so urgently needed  at times it would even appear that the requirements of change are at variance with efforts being made in this world forum, and this has given rise to the terrible paradox that whereas on the one hand we wish to maintain confidence in our resolutions and recommendations, on the other hand we are reluctant to bow to our organization dictates or to follow the guidelines laid down for emerging from the period of stagnation which, it seems, we have been in for many years i would venture to hope that, as a result of this session of the general assembly, our organization will emerge strengthened  it is to be hoped that it will find, and perhaps also take, the necessary steps to eliminate those obstacles which stand in the way of the smooth functioning of our organization and its dependent bodies, and we must take a more pragmatic and universal approach to events which give rise to disputes, lack of confidence, suspicion and, to put it quite bluntly, conflicts it is for this reason that we wished, first of all, to refer to the idea of a system of international security, for which the government of the dominican republic, at the twentyfourth session of the general assembly, expressed support  it is also for this reason that we gave favorable consideration to the report of the secretarygeneral on the declaration on the strengthening of international security [a/and add,  if we could add new achievements to our record, it is likely that faith in the united nations might increase, that distrust among nations would disappear as well as international tension, which is what has disrupted so far the kind of cooperation which must exist among nations if there is to be solidarity and interdependence  and these are the ideals which have not yet found practical expression in spite of efforts to preserve peace in all quarters of the world and to ensure that all peoples will have a right to the common heritage of security, without which we might all return to a period which existed before our present civilization, perhaps even to a time of barbarity  if we could only make progress on these lines, that would surely go a long way towards the settlement of many items on our agenda unquestionably, putting an end to the armaments race and using those astronomical sums for social and economic improvements in nations would be one of the most effective ways of ensuring security the arms race and military expenditures are also dealt with in the report of the secretarygeneral, and these matters deserve the consideration of member states of this organization  we realize, however, that this is one of the thorniest and most controversial problems  it concerns most the major powers, although the considerable sums being expended everywhere in the world to maintain military forces and modern weapons constitute one of the greatest obstacles to economic and social progress, which is so sorely needed because of the changes to which i have referred  but these needs have been ignored so frequently whenever we have reached a standstill on the question of disarmament or considered an end to the arms race, or even a truce in atomic tests and many other related matters which we can scarcely overlook the latin american countries, through their respective heads of state, set forth their positions in punta del este in april with regard to the need to reduce these military budgets, for the same reasons  and the same kind of recommendations were put forward with firm conviction and determination at the general assembly of the organization of american states in san jose, costa rica, from to april of this year on this subject we cannot fail to endorse the words of a latin american statesman in san francisco during the tenth anniversary of the signing of the united nations charter, when he said:we have faith and confidence in the united nations because we hope that its labors will give the world a better future and will create an atmosphere of security and tranquility for the fruitful work and the utilization of scientific achievements, which will permit spiritual and physical wellbeing, progress and general welfare, that faith is unshakable and my country will therefore do its utmost v as it has done in the past, to cooperate in completing the vast task still before us we realize that not everything depends upon the united nations alone the world is now divided into such divergent camps that the united nations has very often not been in a position to apply its full strength to the completion of hie task it had begun, a task which would redound to the benefit of mankind that being th  situation, we must face the problem squarely and speak frankly  all this has special relevance to the problems on our agenda, to which i now wish to refer on more than one occasion we have felt it appropriate to refer to the views of our government on the policy of apartheid, especially during tills international year for action to combat racism and racial discrimination ever since the debate in san francisco that gave rise to our organization my country has advocated the elimination of discrimination, and we voted in favor of the principles on this subject contained in the charter that occurred more than a quartercentury ago, and what was stated then, in our view, is not restrictive, but we should now spell out what we meant at the time if we are to create the same kind of awareness today as impelled nations at the time to subscribe to these human principles  we shall thus be able to deal with new forms of discrimination which have ccn>e about in the course of the changing lives of men and peoples, and which we trust we have reflected in this statement governments are the concrete manifestation of the state, and peoples are an essential element of nations, and very frequently they must suffer from the consequences of discrimination, which violate one natural sense of justice and are at odds with the principle of solidarity , for without a desire for justice and solidarity it is difficult to understand why nations would have been willing to become members of this organization and work together for progress and peace  that is why we are bound here to speak about a general pattern of discrimination among countries great and small that are members of the united nations  between small countries that are members of the organization and others that are not yet members and between small member states and others that have only recently taken on an independent juridical existence after having been dependent territories and that have become independent in accordance with the processes and procedures laid down by the charter  a few from this latter category of mmii states, which became independent in accordance with generally accepted principles, have now come to be known disrespectfully as ministates this is not only a discriminatory attitude; it offends the very peoples we wish to support, but what is even more unacceptable is that it seems to suggest that some states can be both independent and not independent at one and the same time we are opposed to that kind of discrimination  we do not support it and it should not exist at a time when, thanks to certain ideas which have emerged after many centuries of preparation, the advocates of many religions who were previously at loggerheads can now sit down together at the same table oecumenical congresses have shown that divergent views can live together, that isms can be reconciled, and that ultimately everyone will favors the commonweal and recognizes our historic destiny we see no reason, then, to allow any infringement of the principle of universality in the united nations, which is the community of communities, more earthly than divine my delegation believes that it is quite realistic, then, to maintain our policy on apartheid we think that firm policy applies to other matters alsofor example, economic, social and technological discrimination; and any monopoly on science, which is also a way of holding up human progress  we would go still further, though we may be accused of going too far and advocating ideals that are impracticable, like many of the structures of plato republic but today world teaches us that ideals are made a reality as a result of momentum provided by progress, which cannot be stopped  and we must realize that ideals are the greatest good man is heir to  so it is that today we may proudly say that man has set foot on the moon, and he may indeed go still further if he pursues his intention to conquer outer spaceas one may readily anticipate from recent events we trust we are not in error inasmuch as one of the items on our agenda concerns precisely international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space, which produced general assembly resolution (xxv) this matter has a relation, direct or indirect, to the formal note we submitted to the secretarygeneral when celebrating the twentyfifth anniversary of our organization  in that document we recommended a study of ways and means for depoliticizing outer space, which is another way of setting aside special areas or reserves for peaceful purposes we therefore cannot fail to welcome the inclusion of item on our agenda which corresponds to that resolution in line with our request to the secretarygeneral, which followed the highest  channels, we are pleased that in this assembly there has emerged the idea of international cooperation in the peaceful use of outer space my delegation supports item of the agenda  the dominican republic is a party to the treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons in latin america (the treaty of tlatelolco)  we sincerely believe that it is possible to denuclearize the area constituted by the countries of latin america  we have no reason to assume that an instrument calling for the creation of a nuclearfree zone to ensure that mankind will not disappear from the face of the earth can produce any undesirable effects, for such a zone would come to be a kind of enormous sanctuary against what is mankind most frightening invention, frightening unless used for peaceful purposes, unless used to safeguard and not to destroy th* human race my delegation supports the idea of using, with discrimination against no one, the resources of the seabed and the ocean floor without infringing on the jurisdictional limits of states, for the benefit of mankind in the future, although we do believe that, until certain matter* that might be termed preliminary questions are resolved, and until genuinely exhaustive studies are carried out on the proposed planning, and until a positive awareness has been created among all states members of the united nations as regards the importance of bringing all parties into the agreement, whether members of the united nations or not, it will not be possible to reach agreement; and without goodwill, the instruments necessary for those objectives would remain without the necessary ratifications, as has occurred in the case of so many other conventions the ratification of which has for so many years been urged by the secretarygeneral it is our hope that all difficulties and obstacles standing in the way of such grand and laudable objectives will gradually give way and disappear, and that we shall succeed in getting off to a fresh start in a task which cannot be achieved in a single effort but may require several further attempts, as we know from experience those nations that have achieved incredible levels of technology, the powers that have been able to say that they have the earth satellite within their reach, thought only of reaching the nearest stage, but none was so pointlessly bold as to try to go beyond that  this is precisely what we should do in so exciting a task as the reservation for exclusively peaceful purposes of the seabed and ocean floor, and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction but this should not be taken to imply that at the present time we occupy a negative position and that we do not recognize that possibilities exist for us, as we have always done, to cooperate in anything that may redound to the benefit of the progress and welfare of mankind we do not wish to take a hard and fast position when considering practices that affect human development and the protection of all rights that are or should be juridically protected whenever we have had occasion to consider the matter of human rights, we have been overtaken by the thought that someone may take upon himself the privilege of casting the first stone  our hesitancy in the matter, which seems to us reasonable when dealing with questions iii the assembly that affect states members of our organization or other states, stems from our conviction that certain kinds of violations are a common sin committed by a great number of nations in various geographical areas of the world, and not in one area only for this reason, we would be more pleased to see the item concerning the violation of human rights considered as a matter that concerns us all, indivisibly  accordingly, we should like to see the studies carried out on subject of massive violations considered in tern we do not believe that these important questions should concern only certain presumed violators, while not even remotely concerning others  the facts of this matter have she ^'n that frequently the very ones who are at fault are eager to point an accusing finger at their neighbor, and even beyond their neighbor quite frequently, in both small and large states, there have been violations of th* right of free transit from the homeland to another land where the people involved believe that they will have greater opportunities or a better life for themselves and for their children we have willingly, or almost willingly, remained inactive in the face of actions that could be termed improper in connexion with prisoners of war; and even more inexplicably, in the face of the lack or near lack of provision for the exchange of prisoners or for the praiseworthy activities of the international red cross in some of these situations events have shown that there has been disregard for conventions and international rules which are based unquestionably on the rule of la w and human rights these then are multilateral obligations which are contained in instruments, or regional or international declarations   on this occasion we cannot fail to put forward a few views on the existence of the republic of china in the world organization  for more than two decades we have given our support on this matter, which has become especially controversial in the general assembly in the past three years  we are aware of the changes which have occurred in international politics recently,when we signed the charter we were aware that in spite of the fact that the united nations had been created by the victorious states, even well before the end of the last world war, the major powers were thinking in terms of the need to concert their efforts before agreeing on a peace treaty or a system which would ban or at least remove the causes and chances of a new allout war, which might pose a threat to present civilization the victorious powers* as long ago as that, glimpsed the possibility of establishing, with peoples opposing war and cherishing peace peoples who either witnessed or were involved in the greatest catastrophe which, the world had ever seen, and by man own doing a systematic organization where as a result of the rule of law a remedy might be found to the ills which led to the scourge of war in view of these undeniable realities there was an awareness of collective needs which led to the creation of our organization, open to all and within a spirit of justice there was discrimination, to be sure, against the conquered at that time  but with the passage of time the dark clouds which then existed have since disappeared there has emerged in our organization the concept of universality; the right of participation in our organization by all peoples attached to peacea just peaceand not to war banned by law, has come to be recognized  our organization has a tremendous responsibility to ensure the smooth functioning of the international community at all times  that is why we have always questioned the admission of any member or the rehabilitation of a member when it has not met the essential requirements of membership of this organization  that is the basic provision of article  paragraph  of the charter in the circumstances we have always come out in favor of certain principles and accordingly we have never failed co repudiate all forms of aggression, as required also by the charter, which it is our duty to support we are saying this on behalf of a member state whose pages of political history reflect the wounds and scars that were caused by failure to respect in  principles proclaimed in san francisco and generally held to this day we know from our own experience just how great the price of peace can be, we are also aware of our great duty to support international solidarity and other values which are equally deserving of respect by all states, it is the duty of all of us to review our positions and to open the door to conciliation and the uncertainties of the future so that we may, with or without skepticism but at least courageously, abandon old traditional patterns to which we have become committed with these comments by way of an introduction, we are now prepared to turn to fr subject we have mentioned  we hold the view that the republic of china should continue as a member of this organization  but in order for that to be so, the dominican republic at this crossroads is prepared to compromise when necessary we should also like to comment now on the subject of action to be taken against nazism and other totalitarian ideologies and practices our country is one which had a dictatorship for more than years  our people back in the nineteenth century were considered to be one of the most bellicose in the world  we were a courageous and vigorous people who achieved independence with frequent displays of heroism thanks to the sole efforts of its sons  we have been able to survive as a free and sovereign state in spite of the many trials which we have been subjected to  only six years have passed since one of the most terrible revolutions ended, which disrupted the entire social and legal structure of the dominican republic we are quite confident that at all times we have discharged the mandate which was conferred on us when we solemnly declared here that not only the government which is represented here but also all the people of our nation reject not only nazism and other totalitarian ideologies and practices, but all forms of totalitarianism, open or covert  our country will vote in all circumstances in keeping with these convictions  we also believe that we are in this way acting strictly in accordance with one of the most important principles of the constitution of our republic another matter which we cannot fail to refer to is the situation in the middle east we have briefly considered the question of the necessary reconciliation of all peoples and the need to give momentum to the means at the disposal of our organization to remove anomalous situations which stand in the way of harmony in the world we have always believed that direct negotiations can point the way to goals which at times have seemed unattainable  this method is probably as old as man himself, and it can be effective whenever there has been a willingness to use instruments which reflect the mandates which have been given to the general assembly and the security council as members of the organization, we have given our moral support to security council resolution ( and to the jarring mission  we believe that the door to a settlement satisfactory to all parties is still open  but we believe that in all conflicts or disputes peaceful action is always possible if the unassailable truth that negotiating means persuading, dissuading and compromising is recognized  similarly, mutual sacrifices are necessary the united nations conference for trade and development is also a matter of keen interest to our country and this is only natural for this is required if we are to do away with underdevelopment, a matter which we have so frequently discussed we can say confidently that in recent years we have done a good deal to get out of this impasse, for at the present time a great number of productive forces have been brought together at home and abroad for the common good  this is a contribution made by one and all and not by just a few, and all parties involved have been active  we must all pursue our efforts nationally in trade and development as advocated to some extent by the united nations conference for trade and development despite our hopes, we have been disappointed to see that a number of international agreements essential for the settlement of the serious problem of underdevelopment have been obstructed because of the reluctance of some and because of other negative factors which have emerged in recent international meetings over the past few years  we optimistically hope that this standstill will be done away with as a result of the momentum provided by the united nations   may i be allowed to conclude my statement by saying that i hope that this general assembly session will live up to our expectations  at the same time i would invoke the words of the chairman of the delegation of china at the conclusion of the san francisco conference;the united nations conference on international organization has concluded its vitally important mission of writing a charter  this instrument will, i believe, prove itself to be an epochmaking document and will rank in its contribution to international justice and peace with the magna carta and the constitution of the united states in their contribution to political liberty and representative government  it is an honour to participate once again in the general assembly on behalf of the people of the dominican republic  i wish to begin my remarks with a special recognition of the work of secretarygeneral ban kimoon  we appreciate his dedication in the search for solutions to the conflicts that have shaken the world over the past years, and we wish him the best of luck in the new tasks that he will undertake the year is proving to be especially turbulent, with territorial conflicts and open identityrelated tensions in various parts of the world  we hope and insist, of course, that the international community will find a peaceful outcome to those conflicts — first and foremost for the sake of the millions of lives that are affected by them  sometimes the urgency inherent in those tragedies weakens our commitment to address problems that appear to be less pressing but are the most important in the long term one such issue, with perhaps the largest scope and greatest potential for longterm transformation, is the fight against poverty and inequality  over the past two decades, the rapid economic growth brought about by economic globalization has fuelled high expectations in the countries of the south  in fact, it was believed that the prosperity enjoyed by a few countries might finally be within everyone’s reach  it should be recognized that those hopes were not unfounded  indeed, over the course of those two decades, hundreds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty but we cannot let ourselves be carried away by excessive optimism  we have an obligation to clarify the scope of those gains in the light of the actual data  we must also expand our horizons to observe those places and areas where globalization has not kept the promises made to humankind to begin with, we must remember that all of the hundreds of millions of people who were recently lifted out of poverty did not automatically become part of the middle class, nor did all who were able to do so necessarily remain there  we have, then, a new social segment, a segment that has already been lifted out of poverty, but whose position is much too fragile for us to consider it definitive  the word used to describe the situation of those men and women is “vulnerability” — vulnerability to unemployment, to the illness of a family member, to an economic crisis or a natural disaster, and vulnerability to a series of unforeseen events that could ruin their prospects for the future and return them to poverty in just a short time that vulnerable group now includes more than billion people around the world, who represent more than per cent of the world’s population, according to united nations statistics  that population is especially large in latin america and the caribbean, where the majority of people earn between $and $a day  the challenge that we face is to strengthen the position of that emerging class  we must provide them with security and give them the tools and skills enabling them not only to develop their own lives, but also to participate in the development of their countries let there be no doubt that new social class offers a great opportunity for our nations  because of its expanded capacity for consumption and its ability to save, that social class has the potential to become, as has already been noted, an economic growth bonus, similar to the socalled demographic boom that our countries have seen as well  to bolster the emerging middle class will require more complex and better quality products in all sectors, from infrastructure to education  the path of that class to progress will enable our countries and the entire world to progress but in order to realize all of that potential, we must strengthen the safety nets and social supports in the areas of health, education, employment and social security, so as to keep vulnerable individuals from falling back into poverty  if we take that opportunity, not only can those men and women leave their difficulties behind forever, but they can also convert their countries into middle class, democratic and peaceful societies with less need to emigrate abroad  in other words, they can be the key to farreaching changes on our continent within the framework of the assembly, the postdevelopment agenda, the agenda for sustainable development with its sustainable development goals, provides a good road map for many of the challenges that we face in latin america, the caribbean and the world  our country believes that it is important to work every day to reduce suffering and to develop strategies to ensure that the path out of poverty is a path of no return  however, in order to accomplish those goals, in order to lift people out of poverty — hundreds of millions of people — more is needed than merely adopting a series of formulas and indicators profound changes must urgently be made to the methods by which trade and financial flows are carried out  that is to say, it is necessary to revise the rules of the game between rich countries and poor countries  we are talking about trade  we live in an age of unprecedented trade openness  my country, the dominican republic, like many others, has signed free trade agreements with the major economic blocs, which ought to be mutually beneficial — and in many cases they are  however, if i may say so in all honesty, there are times when the developed countries engage in hypocrisy  after more than half a century in which those countries were protected from everything that other countries were able to produce better, now those countries refuse to reduce protectionism within their borders, whereas under the free trade agreements they require that from their counterparts in developing countries  they want us, the developing countries, to eliminate our protections on industrial goods, but they do not eliminate agricultural subsidies for the next five years, for example, the united states will provide an average of $billion annually to support its agricultural sector, and in its multiyear subsidy policy for the period  the european union will devote €billion to subsidize its agricultural sector  the agricultural protectionism practised by rich countries allows them to influence the market in their favour, while tariffs and trade barriers routinely exclude products from developing countries in addition, other nontariff barriers, such as phytosanitary regulations, are not transparent; they also create additional barriers to farmers in developing countries seeking to enter the global market  the developed countries have allowed those market distortions to persist and have continued to make rhetorical statements in favour of free trade  they should, rather, take concrete steps to attain the ideal of genuine free and fair trade recently, countries such as ours that have signed on to free trade agreements have been forced to revise the terms of our existing agreements because of such protectionist practices that create situations of unequal competition  if the industrialized countries want to be true to their word, they must agree to significantly reduce their protectionism and their subsidies during current trade negotiations and, at the same time, ensure increased funding for rural development just as we should seek greater fairness in trade, we must also ensure that financial flows serve as partners of development and productivity  for some time now, we have been living in an economy where the financial sector is becoming increasingly important  that is a reality that brings as many opportunities as dangers  we were all able to see, for example, how a purely financial crisis like the one that broke out in the  following the bankruptcy of lehman brothers, was able to jeopardize years or decades of development efforts in many of our countries we have also had the opportunity to confirm how the free movement of capital can be used for the purposes of tax evasion or moneylaundering  the dominican republic, like many of the countries present in the assembly today, can only benefit from more stable, predictable and better regulated financial markets  therefore, this year, we have begun to adopt the antimoney laundering recommendations of the financial action task force of latin america  those measures include greater supervision of financial institutions, greater transparency of the legal status of persons, ensuring the legitimate ownership of assets, monitoring wire transfers, documenting retention policies, creating a framework for international cooperation and providing mutual legal assistance, among other measures, for making the dominican banking system safer and more transparent it is worth noting that news such as the recent european union ruling ordering the technology company apple to pay €billion in unpaid taxes plainly demonstrates a reality that we have long known, namely, that tax havens do not necessarily exist only in sunny caribbean countries  quite the contrary, the great majority are under the jurisdiction of the richest countries  moreover, contrary to the widespread idea that tax havens are merely places to conceal money, they are primarily platforms from which to conduct financial and trade operations in global capital markets  that is to say, it is not money stowed under the mattress but rather an integral part of the real economy that siphons resources from it and robs states of their prerogative of fiscal sovereignty the lack of regulation has paved the way for tax evaders and has made the work of tax authorities more complex  it constitutes a major threat to state funding worldwide, which undermines the ability of governments to meet their enormous responsibilities to their citizens  we therefore applaud any initiatives that promote greater regulation of tax havens  we also know that the regulation of tax havens must be part and parcel of a larger system of effective public regulation and monitoring of financial markets, so that they can serve the real economy and its citizens it is our responsibility to continue to try to lift millions of people out of poverty, but we must do so by setting education, health, employment and socialsecurity policies that build on past successes and enable us to forge ahead  we will continue to be committed to the global exchange of goods and services, but let us ensure that those exchanges are fair and on a level playing field  we will open the floodgates of investment, thereby multiplying possibilities for production, research and growth, but let us also ensure fairness and transparency so that, in the medium and long term, our investment and growth will be in the service of the vast majority rather than a select few let us build the necessary consensus to humanize the global economy  let us bring the openness that we demand in finance to the regulation of migration flows  let us use the same creativity and enthusiasm that we bring to launching lucrative businesses to finding solutions for those most in need  the millions of people who have recently emerged from poverty are the best proof that great things can be achieved when there is political will  those millions of men and women are also our best partners and the primary reason to continue our work  we have made great strides, but there is a long road ahead of us  the steps ahead will require boldness and honesty  we must do away with taboos, rethink paradigms and redefine the rules of the game  our country is committed to substantially reducing inequalities, but not only between the richest and poorest inhabitants of our countries, but also in reshaping the international relations between poor and rich countries let us sit together for a dialogue based on mutual respect, equality and for the common good, without any privileges  let us do so convinced that that is the only way that humankind can prevail  the time of zerosum games is over  it is time for all of us to add value  it is time to form alliances that seek to build and where all allies are equal  the international community can always count on the dominican republic to help along that path and to work in the service of the vast majority, who needs us  the delegation of thedominican republic takes great pleasure in extending itswarmest congratulations to mr  samuel insanally on hiswellmerited election to preside over the general assemblyat this fortyeighth session  a man from our america  and,more specifically, from the caribbean region, where both ofour countries are located  he has the required abilities andexperience successfully to guide our work at this session,which must confront and deal with the major challengesfacing the international community, namely, the achievementof peace and the economic and social development of ournations we also wish to express our appreciation to theoutgoing president, mr  stoyan ganev, for the wisdom withwhich he led our deliberations at the previous session i should also like to take this opportunity to extend ourthanks to the secretarygeneral of the united nations,mr  boutros boutrosghali, for his commitment and for hisefforts to carry out the principles and purposes of theorganization’s charter today, in our america, we are witnessing thebeginnings of a negotiated solution to conflict, and we arepleased that in central america, and particularly in elsalvador, nicaragua and guatemala, the disputes that havedisturbed the peace and hindered the development of ourpeoples are now being resolved at the negotiating table  inour island of hispaniola, imperial and colonial rivalrydivided the population into two peoples who, over the courseof time, established two independent states  the dominicanrepublic, which we represent here, and the republic ofhaiti  the efforts being made by the haitian people andtheir leaders, with international assistance in the form ofnegotiations under the aegis of the united nations and theorganization of american states, are now beginning to bearfruit and will, we trust, restore normalcy to that fraternalcountry with the reestablishment of constitutional order in that connection our delegation reiterates its appeal tothe international community to lend real assistance tostabilize the democratic regime and to ensure the economicreconstruction of haiti  assistance and cooperation adequateto meet the needs of peace and employment  thedominican republic, in so far as it is able, remains ready tocontinue to cooperate with this fraternal people to lighten theheavy burden of its current problems in this respect, we are pleased to report that the primeminister of the haitian government, mr  robert malval,recently made an official visit to the dominican republic,with a view to fully normalizing relations between thedominican and haitian peoples and establishing the fullspectrum of relations between the two countries, in theirmutual interest  i am happy to say that the haitian primeminister was given a very warm welcome by the presidentof the dominican republic, mr  joaquín balaguer, who hasalways been interested in finding a solution to our brothercountry’s political conflict and especially in alleviating theserious economic situation there  as a result of the meeting,the two statesmen reached an agreement, subsequentlyformalized, that will ensure the speedy and constructivenormalization of relations, with real reciprocal cooperation,between our two states there is no more appropriate forum than this for me,on behalf of my country and government, to appeal againfor massive aid from the most developed nations of theearth to that afflicted and impoverished neighbouring brothercountry since the conquest and colonization of america, thedominican republic has defended human rights  it was inour island, hispaniola, that a loud voice was first raised onbehalf of the rights of the indigenous inhabitants of ouramerican lands  the voice of brother antón de montesinos,in his famous advent sermon  faithful to that first call forthe redemption of our continent, our government honoursthis historical tradition, which is fully valid today in ourcountry’s official and private practice  it has been workingon instruments  which might eventually becomeinternational in nature  that will contribute to givingjuridical force to that tradition general assembly  fortyeighth sessionour country has advocated the universality of humanrights  we believe that neither geographical, economic,social, religious nor cultural differences can ever be used asa pretext for showing contempt for human rights the dominican delegation believes that, because of theincrease in the membership of the united nations  currentlyat countries  there should be a more equitablerepresentation in the security council, while at the sametime we continue to abide by the provisions of paragraph 1of article of the united nations charter  now that thebipolarity of the past has disappeared and the use and abuseof the veto are fading, the council should become morerepresentative of the new international reality  this shouldbe done in broad consultations, after due reflection and withaccount taken of the need for equity, so that the council canbecome more representative without its effectiveness beingin any way mitigated or weakened  rather, its authority andresponsibility will be enhanced so that it can respondeffectively to any crisis with which the internationalcommunity might be confronted, as the council has donerecently  in this regard, we consider that it would bepractical and feasible to give the council greater flexibilityin meeting the just aspirations of nations, such as therepublic of china, that wish to become members of theunited nations and cooperate in carrying out its principles i would now like to express our views on developmentsin the international situation, particularly on conflicts that, inone way or another, have been affecting international peace i shall refer first to the central american crisis, which,happily, today is on the road to a definitive solution becauseof the positive evolution, under the auspices of the unitednations, of the el salvador peace agreements, and the recentreturn to democracy in guatemala, which augurs well for theinstitutionalization of peace and prosperity in that region next, we would like to refer to one of the mostcomplex and difficult conflicts facing the internationalcommunity today  that is, the existence of extremenationalism, which in some cases has led to fratricidal warsand the annihilation of large groups of people because ofracial and cultural hatred  this has happened in the formeryugoslavia, where even now, despite the efforts of theunited nations and intensive diplomatic activity, blood isstill being shed between brother peoples that until recentlylived together under one flag  our government wishes tosee a swift solution to the situation in the former yugoslaviaand reiterates its support for measures taken by the securitycouncil, in particular the establishment of an internationalwar tribunal to pass judgement on crimes against humanitycommitted in some areas of the conflict we would especially like to point to one positivedevelopment that represents perhaps our best hope for peacetoday: the transitional agreement between the palestineliberation organization (plo) and the government of thestate of israel  the longstanding conflict in the middleeast engendered dangerous tension that has kept the entireworld in suspense and has been regarded as the potentialsource of a future conflagration of incalculabledestructiveness in connection with the development to which i havejust referred  the agreement between the palestinians andthe state of israel  it might be time to defer considerationof or remove the items on that conflict that have longappeared on the general assembly’s agenda  with thisreciprocal exchange of olive branches of peace, we can seethe promise of harmony between peoples that have beenliving in such uneasy proximity we must recognize how the persistent diplomacy of theunited states contributed to securing the results that havebeen achieved  the united states considered the situationwith a view to deciding what was possible in relationsbetween the arab and jewish peoples  the agreementculminated in the signing at the white house in washington in our opinion, that demonstrated unequivocally and veryclearly to international public opinion the sincerity of theparties, who were fully aware of the extreme importance ofthe commitments into which they were entering we must constantly stress the importance of theenvironment  after economic crisis and the imbalancebetween north and south, the major challenge facingmankind is the environmental crisis  the gradual destructionof ecosystems and the deteriorating quality of life of humanbeings are unavoidable aspects of everyday existence for thepeoples of the world  thus, it is essential that the course ofevents be changed  the political will of governments andof all those who participate in organized civilian society willbe necessary to our taking up this great challenge, whichwill involve commitment on the part of everyone  acommitment from all mankind in that connection, the dominican republic supports thegeneral outline of the plan of action that was adopted at thesummit conference on environment and development in riode janeiro in  here we have a valuable instrument forpolitical programming and regional cooperation to protect theenvironment in latin america and the caribbean the latter part of the twentieth century has witnessedmajor changes in world political affairs, ranging from theend of the cold war to democratization in the countries offortyeighth session  october leastern europe despite this ideological thaw, however, westill have arms trafficking and nuclear arsenals and,therefore, a serious threat to peace let me refer once again to the situation in the koreanpeninsula and mention specifically north korea, which iscontinuing its nuclear research and investing enormousresources in this undertaking  let us invite the governmentof north korea to become a party to the universalagreements on the control of nuclear weapons  let us inviteit to cooperate transparently and effectively with theinternational atomic energy agency in that body’simportant task of inspecting and monitoring nuclearfacilities  willingness to do so would constitute evidence ofthat government’s respect for its own nation and of itsconcern for the future of its people and of all mankind we support united nations measures to put an end toarms trafficking  we support efforts to ensure transparencyin military expenditures so that military activity may bemade more predictable, and peace and international security,at the regional and world levels, strengthened let me now turn to two important issues that are stillon the agenda of this assembly may i, first, draw the attention of the internationalcommunity, as represented here, to the positivedevelopments in the area of drug trafficking, which are dueto the success of many measures aimed at combating anderadicating what has for too long been one of the mostominous scourges of mankind  none the less, we mustredouble our efforts to ensure that measures are implementedboth internally and internationally and result fromcoordinated policies of all the nations represented here today the dominican republic has just become a party to theunited nations convention against illicit traffic innarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and the protocol amending the single convention on narcoticdrugs of  bringing itself up to date on internationallegislation in order the better to play its role in collaboratingwith other states and agencies the other issue to which i wish to refer is the economiccrisis affecting most countries of the world  today, thephenomenon of globalization of the economy and integrationof regional blocs is typical of the international situation,which is evolving so rapidly that countries such as mine canno longer put off negotiations to determine their participationin multilateral freetrade agreements, customs unions orregional markets in this connection, the international activities of thedominican republic focus on the economic programmes ofcountries in our region and regional organizations that canhelp in our development and in our enjoyment of technicaland financial cooperation the implementation of appropriate domestic policies byour government will ensure that trade and investment willbecome the ideal means to strengthen bilateral relations,underpinned, of course, by the unilateral granting of tradebenefits under the caribbean basin initiative and by theopening up of our market under the americas initiative in the new international order, another of the majorchallenges that the dominican republic must face is thenorth american free trade agreement (nafta) and itspossible implications; we understand that nafta, as atheoretical possible outcome, would imply an effort towardsthe complete liberalization of trade throughout thehemisphere i should like to emphasize the dominican republic’sstrong support for holding a world summit for socialdevelopment to take up matters relating to the socialsituation in the world, particularly that of women, youngpeople, the elderly, the handicapped and families  thesummit will have to deliver a clear undertaking for commonpolicies to defend and protect these important segments ofthe world’s population collectively, and we hope that manyof our countries will take measures to extend coverage andprotection for these social sectors, especially for children andthe elderly we should like to draw to members’ attention a subjectof serious concern to my government and country, and thathas complex and serious ramifications that will be broughtbefore the appropriate forums during the fortyeighthgeneral assembly session  this is the secretarygeneral’sproposal to merge the international research and traininginstitute for the advancement of women (instraw) withthe united nations development fund for women(unifem)  theoretically, the general assembly will studythis proposal in november my government attaches the greatest importance to thisdecision, and requests this world forum to give it its closestattention in order to avoid committing a grave injustice bytaking hasty action or the like instraw was conceived at the first worldconference on women, held in mexico city in  andwas established as the result of a series of resolutions,including, we should like to recall, economic and socialgeneral assembly  fortyeighth sessioncouncil resolution of may  this resolutionspecified clearly that the permanent headquarters of theinstitute was to be my country, the dominican republic, adeveloping country moreover, my government gave the united nations thebuilding that is being used as the institute’s headquarters not only that, it had to make significant investments interms of money and other resources in order to overhaul thebuilding to bring it up to the specifications required by theorganization we request the secretarygeneral to postpone anyaction leading to merger between instraw and unifemuntil such time as the general assembly considers hisproposal and comes to its own conclusions on the matter also, it would seem that there is an attempt being madeto ignore, unilaterally, the agreement between the unitednations and the host government that is the legal frameworkwithin which instraw operates  my government regardsthis as a serious  an extremely serious  impropriety, andreserves the right to use all relevant legal means to assert itslegitimate rights finally, the delegation i lead calls upon the consciencesof all nations and on all those leaders who bear upon theirshoulders responsibility for the destiny of their countries andthe world, for peace, common sense and mutual respect toprevail over violence and for there to be cooperation andsolidarity between peoples; for these are the supremepurposes of this organization  on behalf of the government and the people of the dominican republic, it is a pleasure to extend our warmest congratulations to mr  srgjan kerim of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia upon his recent election as president of the general assembly  we would also like to take this opportunity to greet the members of the general assembly   during the four years following the millennium summit of  the dominican republic went through a crisis, during which our national currency was devalued by per cent  our working class had to double its efforts simply to meet their basic subsistence needs  drug trafficking and high levels of crime gained a foothold, and our credibility went down worldwide  according to the statistics of the world bank, the united nations development programme and the economic commission for latin america and the caribbean, more than million out of the million dominicans sank into the lowest levels of poverty  at that time, we were facing one of the most dramatic crises in the modern history of the dominican republic   since we took the reins of administration in  the dominican republic has managed to recover the confidence of investors and entrepreneurs  we have been able to reactivate economic growth  we have been able to reduce inflation  we have increased jobs and improved social conditions and quality of life for the dominican people   however, exactly when we began, just like the phoenix rising from its own ashes, a gloomy international picture threatened to darken our prospects for future growth  in recent weeks, for example, the price of oil on the international market has reached an unprecedented rate, and projections point towards continued increases  these price increases are asphyxiating our economies   similarly, in recent times, as a result of changes on the international stage, free zone companies in the dominican republic, alongside those in mexico and central america, have been losing their competitive edge to asian countries  this drop in competitiveness has resulted in the loss of jobs, production stagnation and a shortage of new investment   moreover, while the price of oil is rising, and with the prices of goods in the global economy fluctuating, we also find ourselves unexpectedly affected by price increases for food  all of a sudden we are surprised by the news that owing to the elimination of export subsidies in europe, the price of milk has increased on the international market  the same has occurred, although for different reasons, with the cost of corn, soybeans and wheat as well as with other products that comprise the basic nutrition of the family  because of the climbing prices of those products, the cost of chicken, turkey, bread and eggs have also risen   as will be appreciated, we are facing a dangerous situation which could lead our people towards widespread famine and, consequently, a plunge into extreme poverty  those factors have led to a vicious cycle that is spreading throughout the global food chain, while, in spite of the plea for free trade, producers in the world’s most powerful countries remain protected  as an example, while a united states  farmer has access to stateoftheart farming equipment, the most modern facilities and technologically proficient staff, that farmer also receives government subsidies of approximately us $per year  furthermore, the farmer might produce a pound of corn for a mere cents   at the same time, félix david garcía peña, also a corn farmer, who belongs to the association of farmers in san juan de la maguana in the southern part of the dominican republic near our border with haiti, is struggling alone to make ends meet and to lead a decent life  his farming equipment is outdated  his tractor emits clouds of smoke every morning when he attempts to turn it on  his facilities are dilapidated  he receives no government subsidies since the government is in no financial position to help him, and his production cost for one pound of corn is cents, almost double the production cost of the subsidized united states farmer  when we asked felix how we, as the government, could help him, he stated, “i don’t want anything  all i want is fair trade to be able to sell my corn  the fact is that the challenges of globalization are having a marked impact on countries like the dominican republic  what we are experiencing is the interdependent character of current international trends  what seems to be a distant or remote event nevertheless has a direct impact on the daily lives of our peoples   another example that illustrates the undeniable interdependence of all nations on earth is climate change  that topic is not new to our discussions in this organization, but with each year that passes we find ourselves closer to the predicted disasters   in the dominican republic, we are already experiencing the impact of climate change in various ways: an increase in the volatility and frequency of floods, droughts and hurricanes that destroy our ecosystem, our biodiversity and our infrastructures  also, we are experiencing increased coastal erosion and loss of beaches as well as frequent bleaching of our coral reefs, thus reducing our marine biodiversity and making tourism less attractive   given all those challenges presented by globalization, a country like the dominican republic asks itself: where is international solidarity, where is cooperation between peoples, how are we going to address together all of those challenges which affect most of the peoples of the world   the truth is that there cannot be solidarity when there are those in the world who seek to accumulate wealth even while others suffer  there cannot be cooperation when there are people who think only of conducting business without taking into account the pain and anguish of others   the united nations system was created to promote solidarity and cooperation, and it is only fair to recognize that there is no other organization at the world level that has the prestige, capability and vocation of the members of this world organization  however, this grand forum of humanity, established after the enormous sacrifices of the second world war, must also reform itself, if it intends to fulfil the ideals that inspired its creation, as enshrined in the charter at the san francisco conference   the current structure of the united nations is no longer adequate today  the structure still corresponds to the coldwar period, even though humankind has advanced beyond an era when all events of importance were determined by the rivalry of two superpowers   now, in the twentyfirst century, we in the dominican republic do not truly comprehend why the president of the world bank must be an american and the managing director of the international monetary fund, a european and why major global decisions are the responsibility of only five countries   as one of the founding members of the united nations, the dominican republic aspires to a position on the united nations security council as a nonpermanent member  in that position, we would strive to be a voice in favour of the weak, those without protection or shelter, the forsaken of the world  that is our sole aspiration  the dominican republic will uphold, responsibly and with conviction and determination, the values and principles the organization has pledged to represent, as a beacon for peace, human dignity and the civilized coexistence of all inhabitants of the earth   if we review the activities of the united nations since the days of san francisco, we realize that never before has mankind been so deeply concerned with the question of peace, this peace which we have not yet been able to achieve despite all our efforts and despite the material we have collected and examined in the hope of offering this great achievement to future generations  the fact is that the human and natural elements in our difficult task of reconciling various aspirations, ideals and interests are so prominent that we are at times dramatically made aware of our shortcomings, of obvious areas of disagreement and of lack of comprehension how, then, can we achieve peace  that is the main concern of the delegation representing the dominican republic at this eleventh session of the general assembly, which is attended by the largest number of member states in its history — the old founder states, like our own, those which joined later, and the new members which are to offer us their muchneeded cooperation, inasmuch as we agree that the universality of the united nations, one of our longstanding hopes, is one of the main objectives of the charter yet the task of achieving peace has its price and is beset with thorny problems  the price must be paid in respect of any human endeavour and the thorny problems will arise because no path is ever entirely smooth  the peace that we all long for and that would fulfil the yearning of millions of human beings throughout the world has implications and a meaning of considerable importance for the world today; it could be achieved through joint and sincere efforts if each, one of us were to act in accordance with the principles of the united nations charter and develop his capabilities and if nations, like men, and states, like individuals, attained such a degree of social equilibrium and tolerance that they could discharge their domestic obligations without neglecting their foreign obligations and meet their international responsibilities without projecting their domestic policies into the outside world  what i have described is, in short, the good neighbour policy, which has already been proclaimed in the american continent — that admirable solidarity in efforts to promote the common good and the respect for human dignity and for the principles governing modern society and the international community can it be that, instead of promoting peace, the material advancement of peoples corrupts peace, undermines and saps its very foundations  when we examine the achievements of our century and realize the existence of tremendous forces equally capable of mass destruction and of creation, all we can do is utter our desire for peace, a desire surely cherished in all the states which are aware of the responsibilities that would have to be borne in the event of another world war we are living in crucial times  the emergency meetings of the united nations, precipitated by the events in the middle east and hungary, show how, through the united nations, solutions can be worked out that are preferable to dramatic and irretrievably extreme action  the charter itself mentions international cooperation and refers to the standards of conduct and ethics by which normal relations between countries should at all times be governed the dominican delegation appears before the assembly sharing the concern felt by all, because we can neither ignore the interdependence of nations and the universality of the international community, nor believe that a conflict of international proportions would fail to affect us  for this reason, people no longer think in terms of isolationism or neutralism, except as a means of concealing other designs, but on the contrary try to explain their position and policy in such a way that everyone knows with whom he is dealing all this has brought us to the conclusion that today, and in view of the way in which problems were dealt with during the emergency sessions, we are faced with a choice: on the one hand there is extremism, barbarity, the cruel treatment of defenceless masses calling for their freedom and rights, the enslavement of peoples whose name will always live in history and the enslavement of civilized nations with outstanding traditions, jealous of their patrimony and skill; on the other hand, there are the aspirations to a sensible form of selfdetermination, free of extremism and realizable by peaceful and normal means, democracy and all that it implies, the determination to conduct foreign policy according to the principles of the united nations charter and to contribute to world order by measures unaccompanied by schemes of political and ideological domination for these reasons, we wholeheartedly supported the desire of the hungarian people for freedom, a desire which has already been expressed by the dominican people, its congress, its government and its social groups; for these reasons we also sympathized with the process of democratization in poland, beheld with revulsion the repressive measures taken as a result of events in poznan and were shocked by the grim tragedy of budapest, that city flowing with blood and destroyed by the tanks of the army dispatched from the sinister walls of the kremlin by the machinery of communism, which in our day has enacted the crudest scenes of contemporary history general hector bienvenido trujillo, the president of the dominican republic, recently sent the following message to the president of the assembly of captive european nations: “i have the honour to refer to your message in which you, as the president of the assembly of captive european nations, request the cooperation of the dominican government in the adoption of measures which will put an end to soviet aggression in hungary and give effect to the provisions of the general assembly resolution of november [(esii)]  “i hasten to inform you and the other members of the assembly of captive european nations that the dominican republic condemns wholeheartedly the violation of the united nations charter by the soviet union and will support unreservedly any action the object of which is to restore the sovereignty of the hungarian people and to ensure respect for its inherent rights as one of the communities having the finest democratic traditions in the history of christian civilization  “the dominican representatives to the united nations have received instructions to support the suggestions made by the assembly of captive european nations and to join in any move toward restoring to the hungarian people its right to selfdetermination and implementing effectively the principles of the united nations charter, so grossly violated by the aggressive forces which are endeavouring to enslave man and to destroy the foundations of international order and human coexistence  “in accordance with the policy adopted by generalissimo trujillo after the meeting of envoys, the doors of our country remain open to all hungarian citizens and to any persons from other countries subjected to communist barbarity; in our country they will always have an opportunity of working in full freedom and of cooperating with my government in its efforts both to strengthen the country and to promote world peace, and to preserve and defend the institutions and principles which constitute the culture of the western peoples that is why we pay our respectful tribute to the hungarian heroes of the resistance, whose undying memory will live in the hearts of all who love freedom, and we take this opportunity to state that the government of the dominican republic has decided, and has already informed the competent departments of the united nations secretariat, that it is prepared to welcome thousands of hungarian refugees in a genuine desire to alleviate the situation in which they find themselves at this time at the frontiers of their subjugated country we submit that it would be intolerable if communism, by direct intervention with forces of the soviet union, were to impose on the hungarians a government which they do not want, particularly after they had indicated their intention of shaping the policy of their country along lines more in keeping with universal democracy  it is on that ground that the great majority of the general assembly based itself in expressing disapproval of the soviet intrusion in hungary, for this is far from being a domestic question of the hungarian state or one of those political changes which are so common in many countries  the difference defies analysis, and there is no point in dwelling on it the world today rejects ideological interventionism by communism; a fortiori, it rejects communism supported by force  therefore, the united nations seeks to convey, by an expression of majority opinion, the idea that there are many other ways of making a country the ally of another, of making normal relations fruitful ; instead of contributing to the formation of centres of dissension, one should, on the contrary, work to the utmost for coexistence protected by peace and the principles of international equality and cooperation for us the united nations has been and will continue to be the only possible forum for the joint consideration of the problems of our generation  that is why we are so happy that at the present session nineteen additional member states have been seated which, with the few that are still outside our ranks — among them japan — constitute the long dreamed of, almost utopian, expression of that perfect association, which has been moulded by the needs of our civilization  we congratulate them among the states recently admitted there are some, however, which cannot but receive our special congratulations  they are spain and italy: spain, the protagonist of the great epic of america, whose blood, language, religion and traditions we proudly carry in our hearts and for which the dominican republic, as its firstborn, feels so much affection; and italy, the source of our latin heritage, whose friendship for us, and that of its people, its children, have been so constant the agenda of the eleventh session includes delicate, difficult items with important political angles, and other items which help to justify to public opinion the existence of the united nations  we have always believed that the united nations should not be judged by its behaviour in dealing with or solving international problems which, because they affect the supreme political interests of member states, sometimes are, by their nature, not amenable to immediate action on the part of this association of nations  many people see only the vetoes in the security council, and think that the resolutions are not binding or that there is no way of enforcing them, that the machinery of the united nations is no better than that of the old league of nations because it has not been able to restrain the recklessness and ambitions of some states nothing could be further from the truth than that kind of thinking  the united nations, by the very nature and temperament of the charter, is a uniform whole whose objectives are clearly set out in the preamble  in the social, economic and legal spheres, in research into the indices of our civilization, in the work of many agencies, in the interchange of data and of comparative statistics, it has achieved considerable, even unhoped for, progress  what we should like to emphasize, most of all, is the personal interchange which enables men of all countries and races, origins, creeds and religions to know virtues and faults, things which cannot be measured but which, in the long run, enable us to evaluate problems and help to guide governments and peoples for example, there is the progress achieved in technical assistance, on which the hopes of many underdeveloped communities rest; if we look at the records of other specialized agencies, we find in all their plans, in their results, experiments, studies, failures and successes, a solid conviction of success in obtaining what is best and in constantly doing something more for the welfare of the world and its inhabitants finally, let us look at chapters xi and xii of the charter: they govern the treatment of dependent territories and entitle us to raise banners of triumph, for under the charter new states have been created, selfgovernment has been granted or foreshadowed, and, finally, within a few years, in  we shall witness the attainment of independence by somaliland and of selfgovernment by western samoa, territories which have been influenced by the charter and which, through the collaboration of their peoples and administrators, have succeeded in mapping out their future political destiny after all, the united nations is but the work of men and we have to expect to suffer from human weaknesses  it is for all of us to strengthen the united nations and not to abandon it to the mercies of unrestrained emotions, the shocks of marxist ideologies, or excessive nationalism, devoid of understanding and realism  the exercise of authority under the law and of respect for the inherent rights of man will help to make more tangible all that is proclaimed by “the supreme law of the international community” this session of the general assembly is dominated by the grave problems of the middle east and hungary, and it is not too much to say that there is a tendency towards much greater aggravation of certain difficulties in areas with reference to which the united nations has included items on its agenda at the request of some of its member states  let us hope that, with a real understanding of the more urgent matters, those genuinely deserving priority, we shall be able to consider them with clarity of judgement, and that those others which tend to arouse or accentuate differences will be dealt with in a truly calm spirit  that, at any rate, is the consideration which will guide the delegation of the dominican republic in the consideration of the items on the agenda in connexion with the present conflict in the middle east, we should like to stress that, now that the general assembly has made the necessary recommendations for its settlement in the spirit of the charter and now that a ceasefire has been attained in that region, all our efforts and all our energies should be combined to put a speedy end to that situation; it should certainly not be exploited for the purpose of introducing new elements of discord which might precipitate a conflict of greater proportions my country wishes to express its thanks to the whole general assembly for bestowing upon it the honour of selecting its representative as chairman of the fourth committee; it is but a recognition of the constant attention we have given to such problems both during the sessions of the general assembly and during the four years in which the dominican republic has served on the trusteeship council  the delegation of the dominican republic is confident that it will do justice to this proof of esteem, which comes primarily from the latinamerican group, now more than ever united on important united nations problems i should also like to say that our membership for another year in the economic and social council has enabled us to maintain our working association with the other states represented on that important body  in the economic and social council, the dominican republic has been faithful to its ideas of social development, and of the existence of an inalienable right to social advancement, and to a reasonable policy of understanding for the various economic problems of the world since our country is developing its own natural resources; since social law in the dominican republic is being promoted under the immediate direction of the leader who is our guide and inspiration; since advanced social and labour legislation has been adopted; and since our country is supported by a solid and stable economy, which is reflected in the excellent state of its finances, we naturally welcome the guidance given by the economic and social council and, in spite of the magnitude of its schemes, devote ourselves to the great work it is doing for the benefit of mankind in keeping with these ideas, we assure the general assembly that the delegation of the dominican  republic is prepared to serve with enthusiasm the cause of peace, that our position will always be inspired by that ideal, and that, whenever the whole world looks to the united nations for something tangible from its deliberations, we shall approach the intricate aspects of the maintenance and development of international orderliness with more hope than pessimism and with more conviction than despair the government of the dominican republic hopes for peace, for a lasting peace, with guarantees, with respect for every state, with relations based on a worthy concept of coexistence  finally, it hopes that the united nations, in this hour of uncertainty, will be guided by the supreme demands of justice and right and will find the roads that lead to the happiness of all mankind for which we yearn  his excellency mr  antonio guterressecretary general of the united nationshis excellency volkan bozkirpresident of the h general assembly of the united nationsyour excellencies heads of state and governmentsyour excellencies ministers of foreign affairshonorable heads of delegationcitizens of the world when the representatives of nations, including mine, signed the charter of the united nations in san francisco on june  the world was still in flames the horrors unleashed by the second world war were still atrocious realities against which the international community conspired so they would never happen again  as a result of that commitment to peace and dialogue among peoples, this organization was born in whose general assembly i am honored to participate today for the first time on behalf of the dominican people, and in whose name i congratulate the united nations on its h anniversary the world of is evidently different from that of and i am confident to proclaim that it is also better  and it is so, to a large extent, thanks to the united nations effort during these three quarters of a century to maintain international peace and security, encourage cooperation between peoples to solve global problems and serve, ultimately, as meeting point for the nations that share this planet without the un the universal declaration of human rights would not exist, something inconceivable for us today; neither would we have organizations like unicef, fao, the world health organization, the world bank or international criminal courts  nor would have been carried out the peacekeeping missions that, through its history, have avoided so much suffering the world of is better than in but far from perfect  new challenges and threats bring global problems whose scale requires joint solutions that can only be solved through loyal cooperation among the nations represented in this assembly years ago, the international community had to take on the colossal challenge posed by reconstruction after the ravages of war, which in turn brought about additional obstacles that required commitment, imagination and work to overcome however, it would be reckless to deceive ourselves  history is not linear; at every crossroads there is always the risk of setbacks that hinder goals achieved towards development, progress and peace, which are always so hard to reach therefore, as leaders and servants of our respective nations, we must know there is zero margin of error if we intend to face the challenges of our time in our own way and alone if in the years of the un’s existence, multilateralism and international cooperation have been valuable tools, now they are essential and it is imperative that everyone do their part that this meeting of the general assembly has to be held by videoconference is already the perfect example of the main problem we, as leaders and servants of our respective peoples, must face  covidhas put the entire planet in check joining threats such as climate change, which affects us all, but it is highly serious in island countries like the dominican republic  i am not exaggerating if i say that both dangers could bring other conflicts into the equation; which will, as usual, viciously prey upon the most vulnerable as a nonpermanent member of the security council, the dominican republic has made a special contribution to the agenda of the protection of civilians in conflict in the context of covidthrough a presidential declaration that had the unanimous agreement of the council  that is the spirit that should prevail in the immediate future when it comes to carrying out the policies allowing us to stop the pandemic first, extend treatment and vaccination later, and in the meantime, rebuilding what the pandemic has damaged in the dominican republic, the pandemic has hit us particularly hard because we have had a precarious social protection system, with per capita social spending of $compared to the regional average of $ while the paradox exists that we are one of the nations with the highest economic growth in the region, it has not managed, so far, to close the equity gap we all here know, the equity gap will only be fixed by investing in health and education  this is why my government is launching the most ambitious public health program in our history to achieve universal coverage by the end of the year as we increase public investment in the national health system along with this, there is a plan to promote quality education that, among other measures, will provide students and teachers with electronic devices so that coviddoes not disturb at all their educational process  the future does not wait, and our students cannot miss a minute of their learning and this is why our young people are one of our top priorities; we will work to ensure they get the best education  in this sense, i believe there is no better education than a comprehensive one that encourages students’ participation in all areas affecting them  proof of this is the acceptance of the dominicanfrench initiative to promote resolution ( — adopted unanimously by the security council in july — to strengthen the member states’ commitment to the global agenda of youth, peace and security and that directly involves young people in these plans however, talking about peace and security without talking about development is, simply and plainly, wasting time  before the pandemic this organization was already in a reform process to assist member states in achieving the sustainable development goals of the agenda it is evident that achieving these objectives requires an “accelerated implementation” with the purposeful commitment of the developed countries however, five years after the adoption of the agenda, the majority of developing countries are lagging behind, and those middleincome nations  such as the dominican republic— face particular challenges, because although their economies are advancing institutional weaknesses prevail that lead to inequality  it is therefore essential to modify that agenda so it responds to the reality and problems facing each country the dominican republic will spare no effort with the agenda, because for years our country has been implementing a national development strategy that shares objectives with the united nations agenda  yet, i recognize, to achieve full compliance in just ten years is a challenge requiring the collaboration of all civil society, with publicprivate collaboration with a national vision, and keeping in mind the essential assistance needed by lagging countries years ago, this organization was born with the purpose of banishing forever from the international community’s vocabulary the “we” versus “you” or “them” to assume the “everyone”  and this is what covidintends to put to the test  but i predict it will fail if this assembly assumes the threat will be annulled through policies not combining the legitimate national interests of each country with the global solutions adopted by the entire international community  to do this, we must act in three areas: health, education and technology in the field of health, this meeting should help create the conditions of universal access to the vaccine against covidas soon as the remedy is available  from here, we demand that the vaccine be accessible to all human beings on the planet  the reason for the creation of an organization like this is to measure up to historical challenges such as this one  to achieve this, the role of the world health organization is essential, as well as the creation of a global solidarity fund that will serve as a reserve to mitigate the ravages of future pandemics in the field of schooling, we must share the most positive experiences, including online education, skills training and support investment efforts in educational policies finally, the un must be the engine and guide so that the t century is truly the century of knowledge thanks to ever advancing communication technologies  hence, ending the digital divide is one of the urgent priorities for the international community however, all development and all progress will be useless if the values enshrined by this organization in its universal declaration of human rights are not taken into account  the un knows that it has the solid commitment of the dominican republic to defend these values; to advance towards higher levels of human dignity that promote policies to guarantee equality between men and women, as well as protect children affected by armed conflicts, or at risk of being sold as slaves, prostituted or used for pornography  appalling realities happening on our planet today, that we have a moral mandate to eradicate once and for all ladies and gentlemen:i bring to this meeting the mandate of the dominican people to proclaim our nation’s commitment to protecting the environment and to continue supporting the paris agreements furthermore, i believe the time has come to enhance its postulates  in the security council, we have advocated that security factors within the climate change context be more broadly and indepth studied, because a natural phenomenon can cause or aggravate any conflict, mainly in highly fragile areas the occurrence of natural phenomena and extreme climatic events are becoming more frequent and their greater intensity particularly affects the small island developing states  which forces this organization to continue on the path of not considering such phenomena as isolated eventualities, but as common and recurrent realities for which we must be ready the list of threats and complications can scare anyone  however, this organization has demonstrated over threequarters of a century that, through dialogue and cooperation, any goal can be achieved, no matter how remote it may seem whoever thinks one can change the world by one’s self is wrong, and whoever does not know how to measure one’s strength to adjust our contribution will also be wrong  therefore, on behalf of dominican men and women, i share our deep commitment, purpose and work to provide solutions to the best of our ability  close to eleven million dominicans are eager to do their part the dominican republic was in the founding hour of this organization and, since then, has demonstrated its will and commitment in the concert of nations for the sake of peace, prosperity, equity and global diversity  we are aware of our demographic and economic reality, but our condition will never be an excuse for not contributing the best of ourselves as we have tried to do for years the un, as i understand it, is not concerned with diplomacy, but with the future and, as eleanor roosevelt said on the day of the solemn proclamation of the universal declaration of human rights, “the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of your dreams ” let us therefore attain a world in peace, diverse, prosperous and sustainable for at least more years thank you very much  \\ufeffi should like my words to this assembly, to which are brought such important problems and thorny situations, to be a fervent message of the faith and hope of the dominican government, a message brought from the heart of the land where the first institutions were established after the discovery of america and the meeting of races and cultures on behalf of the dominican republic, i wish most sincerely to congratulatemr  guido de marco on his having been elected president of the fortyfifth session of the general assembly  in conferring on him such an outstanding honour, the organisation has recognised his outstanding diplomatic work and his devotion to the cause of peace he also wish to congratulate the president of the fortyfourth session, the ambassador of nigeria, major general joseph garba, on the excellent work he did and on the wisdom and discretion with which he overcame innumerable obstacles we reiterate our gratitude to the secretarygeneral, mr  javier peres de cuellar, who has spared no efforts in the cause of world peace  he has even made several trips to that region of anguish the middle east, and has established valuable personal contacts with the aim of finding a negotiated solution to the crisis that affects that region, in particular the persian gulf we wish to place on record the great pleasure of the dominican republic at the admission of namibia to the organisation  that country should have taken its seat here long ago, but finally its admission has become a reality it is with great pleasure that we associate ourselves with the expressions of solidarity made here following the admission of the state of liechtenstein  it has been welcomed with much pleasure as a member of this family of nations, which has thus come nearer to universality  at this crucial moment in contemporary history it is an imperative need for the organisation to carry out its sacred mission of safeguarding peace at all costs  scarcely five years ago tensions between the nuclear powers were growing more acute, and the arms race had accelerated greatly and represented a terrible danger to human existence  the talks and the agreements on the elimination of short and mediumrange missiles prove that with political will peace can be maintained the unexpected and brutal invasion of kuwait by iraq, which overthrew its legitimate government and violated the sovereignty of a virtually helpless nation, has been condemned by the whole international community  such is the enormity of this violation perpetrated at all levels by the reckless iraqi leader, on whom all eyes are fixed in horror, that we cannot foresee the future course of these events the secretarygeneral, mr  javier peres de cuellar, in his introductory statement to the fortyfifth session, indicated his concern over the crisis in the persian gulf and the resultant danger of a vast conflagration  the dominican republic, as an active member of the community of nations, fully supports the terms and substance of the resolutions adopted by the security council in view of this grave violation, this armed attack that has usurped the sovereignty of a state, and invokes the inherent right of selfdefence as the necessary response of the international community in the face of this gross and unprecedented annexation turning now to my country, the president of the republic, dr  joaquin balaguer, after being reelected in may and assuming office in midaugust this year, has been striving to carry out the arduous task of the modernisation of our state at all levels, executing a plan of economic adjustment and national consultation among labour, management and the general public, which should end with the establishment of our economy on a sound basis  nevertheless, our country, like other developing countries, is facing the serious problem of external debt, aggravated by the persistently low prices of our export commodities  the debt is a heavy burden that hinders our growth and development  reforms of economic policy and structural adjustment that we have carried out cannot be fully effective unless the developed countries adopt measures to alleviate this insupportable burden of debt  in this regard we greatly welcome the initiative of president bush to grant partial forgiveness of the concessional debt and we urge creditor countries to implement similar programmes to reduce or cancel debt through official assistance, since now that the debt has become unpayable it has turned into a problem that can only be dealt with through international cooperation i should indicate that the read of the dominican state has achieved the best results in his policy of providing the country with the infrastructure it requires for its growth and subsequent development  here we should mention the construction of housing, hospitals, sports facilities, schools, local road networks, aqueducts and dams  his government enjoys general recognition and gratitude for the striking results of the creation of new free trade zones in different areas of our country  re is also credited with being the real initiator and main driving force of tourism and the growing development of the tourist infrastructure of our country this vast work of national renewal has been made possible thanks to the climate of democracy, confidence and security prevailing in our country and thanks to the absolute respect of the government for the free exercise of human rights, from the main human right, the right to life, to unrestricted freedom of expression and thought  in this way the noble principles enshrined in the charter and the universal declaration of hunan rights and in international covenants on the subject are being translated into reality  any foreigner coating to the dominican republic can see the reality of a proverbially hospitable nation that enjoys peace, quiet and order under the total protection of its competent authorities we have always been opposed to any form of racial discrimination because such discrimination constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights  so it is a subject of justified pleasure to see how the south african president,frederik de klerk, is becoming reconciled to this view and how he has admitted to the press the possibility of candidates of any race having the right to vote  that presages the beginning of the process that will finally lead to the elimination of the hated system of apartheid  any act of discrimination regardless of its form and regardless of the person or entity it is directed against, is to be censured and is contrary to morality and law  in the light of this reflection, the delegation of the dominican republic believes that the resolution which equated zionism with racism is in and of itself an act of discrimination, and thus we feel that it should be repealed the unification of the korean peninsula is a subject of the greatest concern to the international community  the dominican republic expresses its pleasure at the advances made by the communities of south korea and north korea in the areas of economic cooperation and cultural exchange as part of the process of rapprochement, which, on the basis of dialogue and negotiation between the two sides, could lead to the reunification of korea  accordingly, until the achievement of that unity, we would favour the admission of south korea to the united nations the reunification of germany, an event of such extraordinary importance that it does not need to be emphasised here, constitutes a veritable milestone in the history of the united nations  it represents the most outstanding case of integration and national reconciliation in the postwar period  it shows how much can be accomplished by fraternity and solidarity, and it is the most striking example of integration in this new era of changes and opportunities that can lead to a better future for mankind aware of the extremely serious problem of drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking, the dominican government is implementing severe measures to combat that scourge which so cruelly afflicts mankind  our authorities are waging active campaigns for the prevention of drug abuse, while taking vigorous administrative, judicial and legislative action against the production, use and marketing of and illicit trafficking in drugs i feel it is appropriate here to turn to a subject that is of great interest today the process of transition to a democratic pattern that has been going on for some time now in the republic of haiti  on this subject the dominican delegation expresses its satisfaction at the encouraging progress made in the preparations for the holding of presidential elections that will soon take place in that country  the dominican republic therefore favours the provision of assistance by the united nations in the form of observers appointed by our organisation to assist the haitian nation during the elections by an accident of fate the republic of haiti and the dominican republic share the same island and have known similar vicissitudes on their respective paths towards independence and sovereignty, and therefore we are most interested in seeing our sister nation achieve stability  but our country fundamental interest is not limited to that aspect; it also concerns haiti political and economic development haiti needs the support of the entire international community, since until we, the nations of this hemisphere, have thus far confined ourselves to pointing out the problems without striving to find the right solutions to them, for that reason, we feel it is time to discuss, this delicate situation before the assembly  its scope is more than national, even than regional, and it has become a question that deserves the attention of the international community the dominican republic, familiar with the problems of our neighbour country and aware of its own historic responsibilities, has found it necessary to receive a constant flow of haitian immigrants, numbering more than million, who are competing freely with the dominican labour force  our country accepted this immigration since one of the cardinal principles of its foreign policy is to regard solidarity as the highest elevated expression of human conscience  thus haitian nationals also enjoy the same benefits and prerogatives and dominicans, in an atmosphere of security and respect without discrimination of any kind lastly, we are particularly pleased to state that as the obstacles to the full rehabilitation of haiti are gradually overcome, opportunities for greater cooperation between our two countries will increase and we shall march together towards the achievements of our most cherished ideals and our highest national aspirations in conclusion, i should like to stress our conviction that the united nations is the authentic custodian that will preserve the inestimable treasure of the lofty values extolled at the dawn of a new era of harmony and peace  this bright awakening of the universal conscience reflects the emergence of an era based on the high principles enshrined in the charter of this noble institution, the nurturing source of all the hopes and desires of mankind  it is a great honour for me today toaddress the general assembly at its fiftyninth session,on behalf of the government of leonel fernández andof the people of the dominican republic, in this forumdevoted to the maintenance of peace and the promotionof development and harmony among peoples  onceagain, we are speaking out on the most delicate andimportant issues on the international agenda so that wecan join forces in the search for viable solutions to theproblems that affect us all i extend my sincerest congratulations to you, sir,on your election to the presidency of the generalassembly at its fiftyninth session  we are confidentthat you will steer our work along the path of peaceand security for the good of mankind  we alsounderscore the important work accomplished by theoutgoing president, mr  julian hunte of saint lucia the dominican republic has been struck by aforce of nature that has left death and destruction in itswake in various parts of the country  the rain and thewind of hurricane jeanne had severe consequences forthe eastern part of our country, destroying homes,means of communication, bridges, crops and touristinfrastructure, at a time when the dominican republichad been making increasing efforts to jumpstart itseconomy  we take this opportunity to express ourthanks for the international community’s solidarity inthese difficult times for the dominican republic  iwould also like to express my deepest thanks tosecretarygeneral kofi annan, who has expressedsolidarity with our country and with haiti in thecontext of this natural disaster the fact of globalization steadily deepensrelations among our countries, challenging our capacityto take advantage of the opportunities thatglobalization offers, as well as our capacity to limit itsnegative impact  together with the contradictory andcomplex processes of integration and disintegration,our countries still hope that the benefits ofglobalization will create conditions making it possibleto overcome poverty and attain a good life a tragic event that occurred in this city of newyork on september changed the destiny ofhumankind in a matter of minutes, and made the worldincreasingly dangerous and insecure  the promise oflasting peace presaged by the end of the cold war wasdestroyed by terrorist actions — actions which werecondemned by all humankind and which haveunleashed a steady escalation of violence that hasturned the world into a place of uncertainty we must spare no effort to rid humankind of thethreat of terrorism  we condemn terrorist acts in alltheir forms and manifestations, whatever their sourceand whomever may be affected, and want tounderscore the importance of international cooperationin the fight against that scourge, which should alwaysbe prosecuted in strict compliance with internationallaw, and, in particular, with human rights andinternational humanitarian law the dominican republic is founded on anunconditional commitment to the norms and principlesof international law, and particularly those that relate tothe peaceful settlement of disputes, the condemnationof the use of force, compliance in good faith withinternational treaties and the implementation of theresolutions of the united nations and its deliberativebodies, including the general assembly, the securitycouncil and the commission on human rights we reaffirm the view to which countriescommitted themselves in may at the thirdsummit conference of heads of state and governmentof latin america and the caribbean and of theeuropean union, as set out in paragraph of thedeclaration of guadalajara:“[a]n effective multilateral system, based oninternational law, supported by stronginternational institutions and with the unitednations at its centre, is essential for achievingpeace and international security, sustainabledevelopment and social progress ”however, in order to achieve those objectives wemust streamline, modernize and reform the entiremultilateral international system, a process that statesmust support through respect for and compliance withthe resolutions adopted, without neglecting genuineand effective equitable regional participation multilateralism is one of the main pillars of theforeign policy of the dominican republic, as can beseen by our participation and cooperation in allinternational forums  for that reason, we join thosenations that call for a thorough reform of the unitednations system, with a view to enhancing itsdemocratization and making it a more effectiveinstrument for states members  that reform must begeared, first of all, towards strengthening the generalassembly, the most important body of theorganization, and the security council, in which thereis unequal geographical representation  we reiterate yetagain the suggestion that has been made for severalyears now: the security council should be expanded sothat asia, africa and latin america can have twopermanent members, and the number of nonpermanentseats should be increased in order to democraticize thedecisionmaking mechanism of that forum for peace those reforms are necessary to make the multilateralsystem more agile and effective, so that it may moresuccessfully confront global threats and challenges i would like to echo the commitment undertakenby the heads of state or government who met in santodomingo in august and adopted the declaration ofsanto domingo  in which we agreed that:“[t]he fight against poverty is essential to theconsolidation of democracy  in that regard, it isnecessary to formulate and implement publicpolicies aimed at strengthening economic growthand an equitable distribution of national incomeand wealth ”as we are all aware, the united nations developmentprogramme (undp) has reported that the richest per cent of latin america’s population receives percent of national income, whereas the poorest percent of population receives only four per cent  this factis an attack on governability we want to underscore the importance of ameeting that was held at the united nations lastweek — the gathering of world leaders in an allianceagainst hunger and poverty, which resulted in a seriouscommitment on the part of each and every one of ourrepresentatives here to fight unwaveringly andeffectively to achieve the agreed objectives for the government of the dominican republic,the fight against corruption is a priority  we haveshown this by implementing mechanisms to preventand punish acts of corruption  that scourge has a graveimpact on the economies of our countries  we all knowthat the main victims of corruption are the poor  weneed, above all, to strengthen existing mechanisms,and to produce others if necessary, in order to wage apitched battle against corruption and those who benefitfrom it, regardless of their origin or social class  wehave taken this decision because we see that the rise incorruption in our region has jeopardized thegovernability of all of our countries  governmentaltransparency and a greater participation of civil societyare necessary to combat this evil we wish to emphasize this morning theimportance and effectiveness of the followupmechanism for the implementation of the interamerican convention against corruption, and its planof action adopted in managua  likewise, we ask thatour countries not be used as safe havens for personsconvicted of acts of corruption  we also advocate thereturn of those illgotten gains to the countries thathave fallen victim to this evil, which, together withdrug trafficking, has a negative impact on the stabilityof democracy and the enforcement of the rule of law in recent years, dominican republic has madereal progress in its struggle against trafficking inpersons, where the most vulnerable populations arewomen and children, whether at the regional orinternational level  through the establishment ofnational and international networks against traffickingin dominican children and adolescents, and with thecooperation of the diplomatic foreign and consularservices, we have made great strides in that area  wetake this opportunity to emphasize the participation ofthe international organization for migration and itsimportant support in this struggle as for the struggle of countries against themanufacture and illicit trade in small arms and lightweapons, our country is committed to assisting in theareas of investigation and the adoption of measures forstrengthening global and regional cooperation in orderto fight against this scourge  states must continue tomake every effort to implement the programme ofaction adopted by the united nations conference onthe illicit trade in small arms and light weapons inall its aspects we also want to express our deep concern at thehigh level of kidnappings and crime in our countries —a level that increases year after year, thus worseningthe sense of insecurity felt by persons of all socialclasses and races  the rise in crime is a threat to thesecurity and safety of our citizens and to thedemocratic governability of all of our countries  welldesigned deterrence mechanisms based on zerotolerance, an efficient police force, and a strengthenedjudiciary will all be necessary to reduce this scourge,which has a significant impact on the lives of ourcitizens on a different topic, the caribbean now has thesecond highest incidence of hiv/aids in the world we invite the member states of the united nations torededicate themselves to the terms of the declarationof commitment on hiv/aids adopted at the specialsession of the general assembly on june dominican legislation includes law onhiv/aids, which is now in the process of beingreformed and which represents one of the few existingpieces of legislation in our region regarding thatdisease  we reiterate the request for cooperation to theinternational community so that, through financing, thecountries most seriously affected can have moreresources to deal with the consequences of that illnessin order to provide the comprehensive care that is verynecessary, as well as the antiretroviral medications tocombat the illness  this is based on the right of allcitizens to life and health in recent years and in most international forums,our country has referred to the grave crisis confrontingthe sister republic of haiti  we have drawn attention tothe fact that the dominican republic could not andcannot bear the weight of this crisis and itsconsequences on its shoulders alone  on more than oneoccasion we have called on the internationalcommunity for solidarity  we do so with the intent ofbeginning a farreaching process that can help infinding a solution to this problem  today, we see thatovercoming this crisis represents a major challenge tothe united nations, and therefore we support theprocess that began through the united nationsstabilization mission in haiti  we consider it veryimportant that the haitian people see this peacefulmission as the participation of the internationalcommunity in the stabilization of their nation, and thatthey at no time view it as an occupation force hurricane jeanne has caused thousands of deathsand much destruction in the area of gonaïves, haiti,thus deepening the economic and humanitarian crisis inthat country  now, more than ever, we call on theinternational community and international financialbodies to provide the necessary financial resources thatcan place that nation on the path toward stability andprogress many regions of the world have not yet achievedthe peace to which they aspire  despite all the effortsundertaken in that regard, innocent people continue tolose their lives in a conflict that for decades hascharacterized the instability of the middle east the dominican republic avails itself of thisforum to reaffirm its unrestricted support for the peaceprocess begun between israel and palestine during themadrid conference, for the oslo agreements, forthe recommendations made by united states senatorgeorge mitchell in his final report and for the roadmap presented by president george bush andsupported by russia and the european union finally, the dominican republic reiterates itsposition, expressed in various forums, on the need for aconstructive dialogue between the nations located onboth sides of the straits of taiwan in order to ensurepeace and security in that region i conclude by expressing the hope that thisoccasion has enabled the governments represented atthis meeting to reflect seriously on our destiny — thedestiny of all men and women who live on earth —and also that the united nations will be able, with thecooperation of states, to establish the balancenecessary for the benefit of international peace andsecurity  five years ago i had the honour to address the fifth session of the general assembly of the united nations, when i was head of the delegation of my country, the dominican republic  since then, i have not taken any personal part in the interesting debates of this distinguished international institution, and it is only indirectly, through the foreign ministry of my country, that i have been able to follow from a distance the difficult, complicated and laborious progress of this organization, upon which humanity gazes with anxious and fearful faith on returning to this solemn gathering, entering once again this great laboratory of international political thought, where noble and courageous ideas are struggling to make righteousness prevail, to ensure the certainty of moral and material peace, and to achieve lasting and permanent security, it is only natural that i should draw a comparison between the united nations of yesterday — since everything that lives has its yesterday, its today and possibly its tomorrow — and the united nations of today we must all recognize the merits of the tremendous work which has been accomplished during the last five years by the united nations  its dynamic nature has proliferated in more and more activities; its indefatigable enterprise has created new agencies, its efforts have spread to ever wider horizons  for all these things this honourable institution deserves the gratitude and applause of the nations of the world; but activity, initiative and effort are all the more praiseworthy in proportion as they attain the goals which they set out to attain the greatest brains of our time in the political, economic and scientific world have contributed the best of their intelligence to bringing about the success of the immense project inaugurated by the charter of the united nations, which was signed in san francisco a little more than ten years ago  no other attempt ever made to solve the vital problems of nations was begun with more determination, or was aided by better men and a more united goodwill than this one  consequently, if the united nations is still far from achieving what was and continues to be its supreme aspiration, this is not because it has lacked the cooperation of the best minds, or because its servants, with true devotion to duty, have been grudging of their valour, resolution and loyalty it is possible that the underlying cause of the situation to which i refer is rooted in the very document which served as a birth certificate for the united nations  i refer to the charter signed at san francisco the founders of the united nations, that is, those who signed the charter in  were honest enough to foresee that their work could be improved on, since no work of man is endowed with absolute and lasting perfection  it was for this reason that among the provisions of chapter xviii of the charter, under the heading  “amendments”, they included article  and in obedience to this wise display of foresight, the general assembly, on november  at its eight session, adopted its resolution (viii), requesting the secretarygeneral to prepare certain documentation for the purpose of facilitating, during the tenth regular session of the general assembly, the consideration of the question of calling a general conference for the aforementioned purpose,and for this reason also, the secretarygeneral of the united nations, mr  hammarskjold, addressed his note of july [a/ to the member states, drawing their attention to paragraph of article of the charter and informing them that the provisional agenda of the tenth session of the general assembly would include an item entitled “proposal to call a general conference of the members of the united nations for the purpose of reviewing the charter”  the secretarygeneral concluded by listing in this note the documentation which he had prepared in conformity with resolution (viii) no matter how serious  — as they most certainly are — certain other subjects before the tenth session of the general assembly may be considered, there is no item that demands more immediate attention than this one, because no other item is of such importance to the world and to the very existence of the united nations itself  we are all aware that this subject touches a sensitive spot  we are all aware that the four simple words “review of the charter” produce a hostile reaction in certain quarters  but it is necessary that i refer to this subject, because although the united nations has done a great deal of work and achieved some positive results during the past five years, it is no less certain that, with respect to the fair, logical and scientific revision of its charter, it has made absolutely no progress since and its movements have remained frozen like those of a paralytic, while the waters of time have flowed onward, in their course throughout a whole decade on the other hand, when the founders of the united nations — including the “big five” — signed the charter, they thereby confirmed the complete validity of all its texts, including, naturally, article  consequently the signing of that charter, including article  constituted a recognition of the fact that revision was possible, and a moral and material obligation to respect this possibility  and l am not aware that any formal reservation was made with respect to this article to postpone a problem is not to solve it  to dose one’s eyes in order not to see a conflict does not eliminate or diminish it  there is no material peace where there is no moral peace, and there is no moral peace where there is no justice  it is the request, demand, claim, supplication and entreaty of our charter that it should be enabled to become more and more equitable every day if justice, peace and security are aspirations which increase in proportion to the cruelty of war, then no generation of mankind has ever been in more urgent need of such moral and material consolation than the people of the twentieth century  and, paradoxically, the people of the twentieth century are living closer to the threat of physical destruction than any other generation in the entire history of our planet  the more they need and seek for peace, the more they are beset and threatened by war  the greater and more lasting the peace they seek, the more destructive and ferocious is the war they find  the implacable neutrality of science, which places the inexhaustible arsenal of its secrets at the service of both pacifists and militarists, seems to permit the best and greater part of its inventions to be snatched up by the latter than by the former in days gone by, groups of nations and states had a complex function  they served equally for common defence, collective aggression, or for the establishment of balanceofpower systems which in the long run always proved unstable or temporary  peace was a commodity which could be sold, purchased, or negotiated  in a word, none of the alliances or associations between states had, as its final purpose, the establishment of peace without asking a price, without setting timelimits, without imposing coercive conditions it is the people of today, labouring under the burden of great wars, who have forged the concept of peace as a right which men should enjoy as naturally and freely as light and air  it is the people of the americas in particular, the free men of the americas, who seem to have welcomed, and tried to preserve, this simple, humane and precious idea in this century of great wars, we have witnessed two tremendous efforts to associate states for the main purpose of peace: the establishment of the league of nations and that of the united nations  the league of nations, born in the first postwar period, was unable to withstand the powerful tidal wave of the second world war  today, the united nations is the mast which holds aloft, against threatening gusts, the flag of universal faith and hope before and after the establishment of these two great organizations, regional units were formed, based on local geographical and political factors, which sought simultaneously to promote the success of the great organizations and to further their particular interests  bolivar, the founder of countries and unifier of nations, worked to this end in latin america and began the movement toward a union of spanish american countries which culminated in the treaty of union, league and perpetual confederation signed in panama on july by the representatives of colombia, mexico, peru and central america  this initial act on the part of the liberator has borne fruit in ten interamerican conferences, held in washington, mexico city, rio de janeiro, buenos aires, santiago de chile, havana, montevideo, lima bogota and caracas respectively, which have shaped the unity of the political thought of this hemisphere, characterized by peaceful solidarity and the cardinal principle of nonintervention,if we compare what is happening in the americas with what has happened in the world at large, we shall arrive at the following conclusions: the league of nations, created by the treaty of versailles in june  was formed of and by the group of victor nations of the first world war, and the united nations, created by the san francisco conference, in june  was formed of and by the group of victor nations of the second world war  that is to say, both international institutions came into existence as improvised groups of victors, which expressly excluded the vanquished and even nations which were merely neutral or displeasing to them  for this reason, neither ever possessed, nor possesses, the necessary conditions of stability for a genuine world organization  the ideas of universality and discrimination are absolutely incompatible with one another  consequently, these international institutions devoted themselves to organizing victory — their victory — rather than to organizing peace  i do not think that this road will ever lead to a peace without a victor, to a general, truly universal, indivisible peace, having the character, functions and permanence of something belonging to everybody and intended for everybody the americas have adopted different and more advanced procedures  the interamerican system, in the broad, noble and peaceful sense of the phrase, did not rise spontaneously like a ghost from the battlefields, bringing the scars and bloody bandages to the conference halls and still carrying upon its shoulders the dead bodies of the vanquished  it arose from the bloodless field of the international american conferences and the consultative meetings of the foreign ministers of the different republics of the hemisphere  to create this system, its members did not have to present imposing records of military service, nor were any of them stopped at the door and asked whether they were victors or vanquished  it was simply enough for them to be free men and to love the peace of the americas and the peace of the world interamericanism was not created in haste, nor following a feverish military crisis, nor in an atmosphere still reeking with the smoke and sweat of the battlefield; it was not created with discriminatory prejudices between great and small, greater and less, nor with distinctions between permanent and nonpermanent members nor shackled with the iron manacles of the veto, the instrument of unilateral policy  interamericanism was born of that process of prudent slowness in which time and experience collaborate like wise counsellors  within its framework there is neither great nor small, nor any situation in which one member state can impose its own will, directly or indirectly, on all the others  within this system the democratic principle of majority rule can freely exercise its equalizing function  a child of peace, it advances towards peace with filial loyalty and in a spirit of democratic equality  as an international institution, the organization of american states does not look to the past, where there are no differences for it to adjust or punish, but to the future, for it is only in the  future that we can and ought to find a better world the united nations must really unite in a desire to review the charter and bring it up to date  this charter must not continue to enforce the discriminatory practice whereby some nations can be condemned to exile and prevented from being heard in the very forum where the destiny of the world, and therefore their own destiny, is being decided  these distinctions between great and small powers, between permanent and nonpermanent members, and these authoritarian councils where the desires and interests of all can be fettered by the will of a single, privileged, permanent member, are incompatible with the spirit of the age and with our present conception of states  if the great wars of this century were waged for the salvation of democracy, what is the united nations making of the principle of majority rule  who will uphold the claim that the minority, reduced to its minimum of a single unit, should continue to impose its will on all the rest it is well that the rights of majorities and the rights of minorities should be adjusted freely according to their just and proportionate shares  however, the alternative, which is what we are now witnessing, is nothing but the confirmation in power of a despotism which has overflowed national boundaries to become an international force  this is not what the nations intended, when they met in san francisco in to draw up their charter  and if that huge gathering of victors, out of the necessities of the moment and in order to capitalize their victory, acted wrongly, it is now time for them to revise their charter so that it may better serve the interests of the moral and material peace of mankind the democratic world did not engage in the bloodiest of all wars so that a single will could impose its despotic wishes upon all nations by making use of the very instrument that was forged for purposes of world peace and equal and lasting justice  if the united nations, bearing on its escucheon the blot of the veto, is being used for these purposes, it is either because; it has reversed its historic function, or because its founding charter is defective, or because these two reasons together are conspiring against its reputation, against its stability, and against its very existence if humanity today meets with injustice, let us  endeavour to make sure that this injustice cannot be imputed to the charter of the united nations  let us recognize that it is frequently attributable to other causes  we are prepared to tolerate, for example, the fact that an important new york newspaper should have chosen the time when the dominican republic was honourably fulfilling a debt of humanity and friendship towards a friendly people by contributing several hundred thousand dominican pesos — which are worth exactly as much as the same number of united states dollars — to the victims of the recent floods in the united states, that it should have chosen this time to launch a violent attack on my government and others  yes, we can tolerate this situation, since the press is free, and any one is free to assess the facts and see them or not see them as they are, and free to remember or not to remember the history of my country  but let us not resign ourselves to hearing the same or similar remarks made about our own charter, merely through want of just and timely amendment the dominican republic, as a founder member of the united nations, has at all times been faithful and loyal to the charter  the ideas i have expressed here are not aimed to satisfy any nationalist interest, but are an attempt to do honour and contribute improvements to the basic document which was drawn up by the peoples of the united nations for the purpose of guiding them in the search for universal peace, progress and security  these are the plain reasons which have led the delegation of the dominican republic to advocate the establishment, at this tenth session of the general assembly, of an ad hoc committee to make a calm and impartial study of the revision of the charter, a study which will no doubt culminate in the convocation of the general conference envisaged ten years ago in article my delegation, representing one of the governments which has willingly fulfilled, and continues to fulfil, its responsibilities to the united nations, offers its full and disinterested assistance in pursuing the aforesaid purposes  in so doing, it proposes to demonstrate its devotion to the united nations charter and to help make that instrument as nearly perfect as possible,  in the interests of universal justice, peace and security  at the outset, i wish to express my congratulations to the president of the general assembly upon his election to preside over the assembly at its sixtyeighth session  i wish him the greatest of success in his task and in his efforts to promote the initiatives proposed for his term i am here as a representative of the dominican republic, which was one of the signatories in of the charter of the united nations, which entrusts the organization with the monumental task of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war  in the years since its inception, there has not been another world war, but today we are facing a cataclysm that is just as lethal and destructive as a war of planetary dimensions: global poverty  it is a war with casualties in the millions, which calls for a radical change in the economic paradigm and for the forging of a new culture — the culture of sustainability  as i address the \\x0cassembly, there is no doubt in my mind that to triumph over such a daunting challenge, all nations must make difficult decisions, which will require the full weight of our collective responsibility allow me to refer to the extensive and detailed document adopted at the rio de janeiro united nations conference on sustainable development (rio+ last year (resolution  annex), entitled “the future we want”  in that text, member states renewed their commitment to sustainable development and to the promotion of a future that is sustainable in economic, social and environmental terms for our planet and for present and future generations  that declaration shows that the leaders of the world’s nations are committed to doing what is needed to attain that future  we therefore have a road map with profound implications let us acknowledge that we are taking on an overwhelming responsibility, because we are committing ourselves to building a reality that is totally unprecedented in the modern world  let us acknowledge that development to date has not been sustainable in any way  it has not been sustainable either socially or economically  it has been even less sustainable in environmental terms  the systems of production that we have used to achieve economic growth have been based on methods that have proved to be harmful to the environment, and the systems that we have used to distribute the wealth produced have created deep chasms of social inequality and exclusion over time, we have reached a situation that we now consider to be intolerable: a world in which more than billion people are living in a state of extreme poverty and hunger; a world in which many millions of human beings lack adequate health care, drinking water, goodquality education or decent employment; and a world in which extreme malnutrition and social exclusion prevail to a morally unacceptable extent  if we aspire to a world where development is sustainable, we must first accept our shared responsibility for all parts of all societies, and agree that it is time for actions, not words to translate a commitment of such a magnitude into reality, it must be based on achievable actions and attainable goals, and we must be prepared to take bold action, as we are doing in the dominican republic, on several unprecedented fronts  we are putting citizens at the centre of our policies and making the fight against poverty and inequality our top priority  we are implementing a new development model based on a longterm national strategy built on the pillars of three fundamental social pacts: a fiscal pact, a pact for education and a pact for electricity  we are building transparency into government actions and establishing citizens’ groups to oversee and monitor purchasing and contract systems  we are making support for smallscale agricultural producers a priority  we are doubling the budget for free and compulsory public education  we are extending the school day, and we are putting a permanent end to illiteracy following the commitments made at the rio+conference, we have taken a few steps forward and are moving towards an agreement on a road map that will lead us to sustainable development and to the eradication of extreme poverty  we have implemented a process to determine as accurately as possible what the sustainable development goals for the postinternational development agenda should be we are pleased to note that we all agree that the greatest challenge the world faces is to eradicate poverty and, for that reason, that goal has been given top priority on the agenda of our people and our organization our countries have common problems, but our economic, social, historical, geographical, demographic and cultural realities are different  each of those dimensions plays a role in how those problems may or may not be addressed and resolved  moreover, our responsibilities for the creation of or the aggravation of those common problems, such as climate change, are clearly differentiated my country, the dominican republic, suffers the consequences of climate change, because of its geographical location in the path of annual hurricanes and tropical storms  for that reason, we are working to strengthen and improve our preparedness for the management of risks associated with natural disasters  we are building a collection centre for emergency assistance and are working on the creation of a centre of excellence, dedicated to the education and training of human resources for assistance in disasters, which will serve the nations in the entire caribbean region next month, from to november, the dominican republic will host the third international conference on the hopefor initiative, to which all members of the united nations are cordially invited universal sustainable development is a goal that requires a new vision and approach on the international stage  in order for development to be sustainable in our nations, we must undertake structural reforms that \\x0cwill change many of our policies and our economic and social systems, turning them inside out, the way a sock is turned inside out  with sustainable development, we have taken on a commitment of biblical proportions, a universal commitment to care for our brothers and sisters, especially for those who most need to be elevated to the conditions required for adignified human life the organization is helping to point the way with the launch of parallel processes of study, discussion and analysis; panels of eminent persons; consultations with regional economic commissions; the leadership council of the sustainable development solutions network; and the openended working groups that are contributing to marking the path we would therefore like to take the opportunity to express our appreciation for the work done by secretarygeneral ban kimoon in putting documents in the hands of member states that will serve as a guide for our debates and our decisions  one such document, an action agenda for sustainable development, a report prepared for the secretarygeneral in june by the leadership council of the sustainable development solutions network, is a bold and optimistic platform  it is an exhaustive and practical plan that requires a collective commitment that we cannot shirk  all reports agree that we cannot continue treating the part of the planet that each of our nations occupies as if the resources that nature has generously put within them were inexhaustible  the world’s forests, water supplies and mineral resources are decreasing, and animal species are endangered  at the same time, we continue to use methods of cultivation that poison or impoverish the earth and methods of industrial production that poison the air we breathe we must revise the very methods by which our economic growth is driven  that is not a new concern for the united nations  we have been talking about sustainable development for decades  what is new now is that the situation has become a matter of urgency the time for words and promises is over  the time for action is now  we must step up the pace to establish the foundations of sustainable development, because time is running out  we must address the purpose, knowing that what we do or do not agree upon in this session of the general assembly may determine whether the future of our peoples, or rather, the future of humankind, will be promising or miserable  that presumption may seem exaggerated to representatives of larger or more highly developed nations  if so, we invite those nations to look beyond their borders and to consider the peoples of the nations from which they seek cheap labour  they must look at the peoples whose human resources they employ to produce their goods and services  they must look at the peoples in the countries that need the industries of the developed countries to process their mineral exports and at the peoples in the countries where they want to market their products for many of those people, the situation is intolerable  that is why we are pleased to note that the documents that have already been written and which are intended to serve as a platform for our debates and decisions have an optimistic tone  they give us, for example, the assurance that if we act now, the problems we face will not become insoluble universal sustainable development, which addresses the challenges that have been so clearly identified, will translate into social justice in the world  it will also translate into peace, international peace, the achievement of which is a strategic goal of the organization to speak of eradicating extreme poverty, measured in terms of living on an income of less than $a day, sounds like an enormous goal, especially because it is estimated that some billion people in the world suffer from poverty  in reality, that is just one step in a long journey  if those who are now below the income level of $per day are elevated to an income level of $per day, we will have eliminated what we now call extreme poverty  however, we all know that human beings cannot meet their basic needs on an income of $per day  the difference in hardship between the one income range and the other is not very noticeable  what happens is that talking about poverty in statistical terms does not allow us to visualize, much less feel, the reality of the human misery and desolation behind the numbers and the percentages  how can we understand the pain of a father and mother who have suffered the loss of their child when the words in which we are informed about that family tragedy are that every seconds a child dies from hungerrelated causes in the world let us put ourselves in the place of parents of families living in a state of extreme poverty  they have to raise their children in extremely unsafe living conditions, without sanitation or safe drinking water, without sufficient resources to buy medicine or to provide each child with food to ensure proper nutrition, \\x0cwithout resources, without a bed or mosquito net to protect him from insects that transmit serious diseases  they have to decide which of their children can go to school and which cannot, or which of their children have to work and which do not we know that a difficult road still remains ahead before we can agree on a satisfactory arrangement for all in regard to the postinternational development agenda and the most effective ways to implement it  let us remember that what we need is not a new commitment  we have had many commitments to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger  we have had the world food summit of  the millennium summit in  another world food summit five years later in  and the recent rio+conference in  what we need now is for those commitments to finally be translated into political action although sustainable development may sound like an economic concept, it really is a political concept  that is why we are discussing it here, at the organization, which is a forum of states and therefore a political forum  economists measure the dimensions or the pillars of reality in economic terms  economists and other specialists can set the goals that must be reached for a sustainable development that meets their exact specifications  but political decisions are the driving force  political decisions are what ultimately determine whether or not the goals are achieved we therefore have the primary responsibility  it depends on us to put the declarations of good intentions into action  \\ufeffit is a great honour for me to participate in the fortysecond session of the united nations general assembly first, sir, i wish, on behalf of the government and people of the dominican republic and on my own behalf, to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the general assembly  that decision was made on the basis of your wellknown personal and professional skills and experience in international affairs  these qualities will undoubtedly enable you to make a significant contribution to the success of our meetings i take this opportunity to extend a cordial greeting to your predecessor, mr  choudhury of bangladesh, and thank him for the competent and authoritative way in which he carried out the duties of president at the last session on behalf of the dominican government, i also have pleasure in extending warm greetings to the secretarygeneral of the united nations mr  javier perez de cuellar, and assuring him of our appreciation and gratitude for his praiseworthy and valiant efforts in pursuing the purposes of our organization the maintenance of peace and respect for the principle of nonintervention are unalterable elements of the foreign policy of my country, as set forth in our fundamental law and supported by our practice in international relations negotiation and dialogue are for my country the ideal instruments for the achievement and maintenance of peace, both nationally and internationally  without peace there can be no economic progress or social development peace is not merely the absence of war or peace imposed by a superior force  peace imposed by fear, conditional upon a balance of destructive power, is despicable and transitory  the fear of a nuclear cloud enveloping out planet prevents the full development of the human intelligence that would make possible the creation of conditions in which mankind could enjoy the material and spiritual benefits of this world  for this reason the dominican republic welcomes with hope the agreement between the united states and the soviet union that will make it possible to establish conditions for the elimination of mediumrange nuclear missiles  we join the other speakers who have already applauded this step in the assembly one basis for peace is humane treatment of and solidarity with immigrants, be they undocumented aliens, political refugees or fugitives from war zones  that is why the dominican republic is taking the opportunity offered by this assembly to consider one of the most harmful practices in this respect discrimination with regard to the mobility of factors of production  it is a littleknown fact, but a fact none the less, that most of the countries represented here practise some kind of discrimination in their immigration policies emigration from our countries is a consequence of the worst economic crisis that virtually the whole of america has suffered since the   despair and hunger force many people to leave their countries, homes, families and friends in search of something better  is it just and charitable to treat our brothers who set out on that painful odyssey so harshly and contemptuously  to do so is to undermine the foundations upon which the longedfor peace must be based the dominican republic is convinced that the basis of a fruitful peace is, among other things, the gradual elimination of the protectionist barriers that prevent the free flow of international trade  those barriers favour certain monopolistic interests, both political and economic·, they increase unemployment and inflation in the countries that take shelter behind this policy protectionism, whether by raising tariff barriers or by imposing quotas, is a twoedged sword that harms producers and consumers equally, to the benefit of a minority  it is extremely difficult, not to say impossible, to quantify the effects of increased protectionism upon our economies  the predictable result, however, is that the path of protectionism leads to the worldwide contraction of international trade protectionism may benefit some, but only in the short term for in the end it harms everyone, including the protectionists themselves  free, vigorous world trade, unhampered by quotas, is indispensable to the wellbeing of the world economy  every protectionist measure removes us further from that objective  we must, therefore, all move together towards a process of liberalization of world trade·, but for that purpose, it is necessary that more countries accede to the general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt),our position on the problem of foreign debt is welldefined  our country is not in a position to honour the debtservicing scheduled, particularly considering the precarious levels of our foreign exchange resources  what is needed, therefore, is a programme that will reconcile what the country should pay and what it can pay, always bearing in mind that economic growth and the subsistence of our: people must not be sacrificed  with regard to our debt to commercial banks, we press for the concession of longer grace and repayment periods by the world bank and the substantial reduction of the interest rates on that debt  as regards our bilateral debt, we firmly believe that for the achievement of bilateral negotiations it is not necessary for us to reach a prior agreement with the international monetary fund (imp) , in this regard we have publicly stated our intention to restructure our commitments with the paris club whether or not there exists a financing programme with the fund  we share the view that the countries members of the paris club should urgently revise their restructuring policies in order to permit multilateral agreements with debtor countries on the multilateral debt, our country considers it absolutely necessary, precisely at this time of financial crisis, for international development banks and multilateral agencies to maintain a net positive flow of resources to our countries  otherwise debt servicing to these institutions will become virtually impossible  what is required is the greatest possible flexibility on the part of international bodies as regards the repayment of the loans, their methods of procedure, credit policies and a greater supply of concessional resources concerning southsouth debt, my country hopes that the financial relations of payment and repayment of external debt with developing countries may be framed in terms of new patterns of compensation, bearing in mind the relative levels of development and the availability of reserves in each of our countries we must all make a determined effort to eradicate the inequalities brought about by social maladjustment which provoke international social agitators, who take a heroic stance in their actions but are no more than criminals on terrorism my country believes that at this fortysecond session the general assembly should unanimously adopt a resolution appealing to all governments to set in motion the provisions of general assembly resolution of  any other course would be a waste of time  we cannot establish distinctions between social agitation and the legitimate struggle of oppressed peoples  another threat to peace is the growing traffic in drugs, a far worse evil than nuclear clouds  we must therefore launch a publicity campaign under the auspices of this world organization to ensure that, utilizing the most modern and sophisticated means of mass communication, we can inform mankind about the dangers represented by the consumption of and traffic in drugs  as repression has so far proved ineffectual, it would be better to work for a drop in consumption, which would hurt the drug traffic my country wishes to emphasize the grave danger to mankind of the spread of aids (acquired immunedeficiency syndrome) with its serious consequences  as was recently pointed out by the holy father pope john paul ii, this is a grave crisis  it has been shown that this illness is not only spreading throughout economically and culturally disadvantaged areas but is also increasing in civilized regions, where its advance has taken on alarming proportions my delegation proposes that the united nations should foster research to find a remedy for this illness} that fellowships be created to help laboratories look into the origin and cause of the disease; and that a data bank be established for the exchange of information about it  this is a matter that is as important as, if not more important than, the other threats mentioned previously, such as nuclear weapons, external debt, protectionism, discrimination against immigrants and the drug traffic my delegation also believes that great importance attaches to the problem of the elderly  many years have elapsed since the general assembly at its thirtyseventh session adopted its resolution endorsing the international plan of action on aging  in view of the enormous magnitude and growing complexity of the question of aging, the government of the dominican republic considers that the time has come for the united nations to adopt a declaration on the rights of the aged and that the governments of all countries, developed and developing, should lend their sponsorship to this matter so that this sector of the population, to which we shall all ultimately belong, may occupy its rightful place in the community and in society in general in our judgement it would also be beneficial to convene in  the tenth anniversary of the vienna conference, a second world assembly on aging at which we would use the same kind of complementary measures employed so successfully at the international conference on population held in mexico city in and at the world conference to review and appraise the achievements of the united nations decade for women held in nairobi in  with respect to the measures adopted by the dominican government to avert the economic crisis, i must say that these have been very appropriate in the fiscal area, the aim we have set for ourselves is that of significantly reducing our fiscal deficit until we make it less than per cent of our gross domestic product  bearing in mind that during the past year this deficit was in the order of per cent of the gross national product, such a reduction of our deficit would imply a drastic reduction in the inefficiency of our economic system  to bring about this significant reduction in the deficit, we are applying important administrative and structural reforms in our economic policy before reducing its expenses, the dominican government is introducing the reform of a fiscal system, designed to simplify our tax structure, to increase its elasticity and to rationalize our tariff system  what has been achieved so far this year indicates that the savings for the central government were five times greater than for the same period last year  this has helped to bring about the duplication of capital expenditure and the reduction of deficits as programmed  the structural reforms include privatisation of state sugarcane lands by sale to the private sector so that the lands may be used for the development of agricultural and tourist projects another structural reform is integration of the production and sale of electric power into the private sector  in the dominican republic, this public service has so far been supplied by a state monopoly in a very inefficient manner there would be little use in my country applying an economic policy directed outside, increasing national savings and reorienting the role of government with regard to the economy if there were not a supportive policy on the part of the industrialized countries with whom we conduct trade  from these industrial nations we require a renovation of the process of liberalization of international trade  we would request them to reduce their subsidies to exports since these are prejudicial to our people  the first world must avoid restrictions on its imports so that the exports of the third world will not suffer some industrialized countries should promote a reduction in their real interest rates even if to do this they have to reduce their excessive budget deficits  moreover, the international bank could contribute by reducing the margins charged for its loans, especially for those countries that are going through an adjustment process  we could create amongst all of us defensive techniques that would enable us to face future increases in interest rates — for example through the use of compensatory financing facilities by the international monetary fund (ihf) , there is little sense in our having net flows towards the imf or the world bank when we could be obtaining from them greater resources than those which we are paying, and precisely when we most need such flows the industrialized countries could contribute new funds to the international organizations so that these, in turn, could be channelled to our countries  latin america will need some $billion annually in coming years  the international bank for reconstruction and development  the world bank  and the interamerican development bank (idb) are being called upon to do their share, especially in the short term  these institutions are capable of expanding their cofinancing operations and partial guarantees of private loans the first objective of ray government global economic policy is to establish selfsustaining economic growth so as to continue expanding employment and per capita income for the population  in view of the growing external indebtedness, my authorities are responding and mobilizing as many material and human resources as possible for the promotion of economic growth and achieving a rate of real growth of approximately per cent per annum during a large part of this year my government second objective is to face responsibly the problems of external debt  in so far as we are complying with the deadline agreed to we are requiring out creditors to accept that these be paid in the roost feasible manner and without extraordinary sacrifices by the people along with those objectives we are working to distribute income more equitably, but not simply by taking away from some to give to others rather, by educating all to produce and create wealth  we recognize that the solution to our poverty is not to divide our wealth amongst more people but to increase that wealth so that it can be better distributed among all  economic growth is the best means we have to do so, and in that way respond to the essential needs of our population to attain those objectives we are orienting our external economic policy  promoting exports, foreign investment and tourism, and requiring more efficient import substitution  to expand our external trade we are seeking a competitive and realistic exchange rate, and trying to avoid protectionist excesses to which we are so inclined with regard to the balanceofpayments problems, we are trying to remove the temptation to increase state intervention  experience has taught us that the final result of such interventions tends to be a wasting of resources and a private sector which is more independent of the government  in addition, we cannot demand that others be less protectionist if we are not prepared to move towards increasingly free world trade we are seeking to stimulate the repatriation of the flight of capital and provide a more secure profitability  we hope truly to reward persons who save so that they can effectively contribute their savings to national endeavours  we are encouraging savings and discouraging consumption, paying attractive interest to those who save and eliminating the subsidies that still exist in our banking system further, we are stimulating the entry of foreign capital, especially if it does not imply debts  accordingly, within a few weeks the dominican authorities will begin to permit the conversion of a considerable part of our external debt into investments  this conversion will significantly reduce our debt and its servicing; it will contribute positively to our economic growth and generate more employment and income for our population  the dominican republic has applied for admission into the lome group  why lomé  because we have a reality before us: the need to rely on the support and solidarity of those industrialized nations which are members of the european economic community  the states members of that community in the lome framework are encouraging autonomous and sustained development of the countries of africa, the caribbean and the pacific; they accord more favourable treatment than the mostfavourednation treatment and the generalized system of preferences; and they implement technical and financial assistance for development in the form of subsidies and special hard and soft loans among other things the dominican republic is seriously concerned at the situation prevailing in various parts of the world where existing tensions and conflicts are endangering peace and stability  our country reaffirms the need to foster national reconciliation in countries with divided communities  similarly, we urge respect for the right of peoples to selfdetermination and for the principle that no state has the right to intervene by force of arms or in any other manner in the internal affairs of another state on the other hand, we are concerned at the indifference of some states with regard to the implementation of resolutions adopted by overwhelming majorities in the general assembly with a view to solving extremely important questions for world security  this apathy calls into question the viability of the united nations as an organization and thwarts its commitment to maintain international peace and security; moreover, it undermines internationalism and threatens the solvency of the united nations it is necessary to strengthen the mandate of the united nations and, at the same time, avoid any initiative that may weaken its capacity for action and its role as the universal instrument of peace  this assembly has before it once again the same crises and conflicts about which it has debated for several sessions  this reflects the repetitive character of the assembly debates and the scanty progress achieved in eliminating tensions and problems affecting the international community  the perpetuation of many conflicts is due essentially to nonobservance of the principles set forth in the charter, lack of respect for the standards of conduct enshrined in international morality and law# and the absence of a determination by the parties concerned to find just and equitable solutions to the problems my government reiterates the need for the immediate and complete withdrawal of foreign troops now in afghanistan and urges all states to respect that country territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty  i express the firm hope that negotiations during the next round of talks will bring about a satisfactory resolution to end this long conflict# thus providing the afghan people with an opportunity freely to exercise its right to selfdetermination in a genuine way  because that invasion of afghanistan is a potential threat to peace  we applaud the mediation efforts of the secretarygeneral and once again express support for united nations resolutions urging a peaceful solution there are today countries facing serious crises owing to external causes and pressures# such as kampuchea and chad  we support# to the extent of our possibilities# every effort being made to establish freedom and democracy in those regions the dominican republic has maintained a traditional position of support for argentina legitimate claims over the malvinas islands; consistent with that traditional position we urge argentina and the united kingdom to make every effort to initiate the kind of talks called for in general assembly resolution  peace on the korean peninsula is a matter of the greatest interest to the international community  however, the objective of unification of the communities of south and north korea must not be brought about by force but by peaceful means  through dialogue and negotiation between the two parties, which should be resumed without preconditions or extraneous requirements my delegation considers that a concrete way to resume the dialogue would be through conversations between the foreign ministers of the two koreas in conformity with the initiative formulated a few months ago by the republic of south korea may i now refer to haiti, the nation with which we share our island of hispaniola, a country with which we are united by so many links that it would take a long time to enumerate them  the haitian people and government face an enormous task in achieving the aims they have set for themselves: freedom, democracy, work for all, and the creation of conditions that enable that people to enjoy its inalienable right to education and health  only through exercise of their human rights will the inhabitants of haiti be able to enjoy the fruits of this world, which its creator has put here for us all  in this respect, the haitian people needs the help of all of us, which does not imply foreign interference in its affairs  we support the statement made here along those lines by president namphy·the dominican republic, for its part, is increasing its bilateral contacts with that sister republic to create a modern system between the two countries involving free bilateral trade; the mutual combating of deforestation; and the exchange of journalists, teachers and students so that we may each learn about the realities, needs and pains of the other and so that, for a given length of time; professionals from one country may practise in the other without discrimination  the dominican republic supports the efforts being exerted to bring an end to the fratricidal conflict in central america  with hope we join in the agreement for peace recently signed by five central american presidents in guatemala  that agreement should be encouraged in so far as it constitutes the basis upon which a commitment may be forged to establish democracy, ideological pluralism, freedom and respect in that longsuffering region of our hemisphere  we therefore unreservedly support the appeal made here recently by the president of costa rica, mr  oscar arias sanchez, for concord to prevail in central america the dominican republic supports all efforts to bring an end to the long war between iraq and iran  in the light of the latest developments in the persian gulf, there arises an ominous question as to the world future: are we moving towards world conflict and reaching the point of no return  we hope that the desire for peace that has been shown by the great powers may prevail in those two nations and in their religious feelings a constant feature of my country foreign policy is our deep concern about the middle east  ours is a nation of immigrants, and our population includes people of both arabic and jewish origin, all of whom are contributing, in an extraordinary fashion, to the development of our country, in a true model of human coexistence  why should that not be the case in the countries from which those jewish and arabic immigrants have come my country feels that the only way to achieve peace in the middle east is through dialogue between the parties to the conflict based on the provisions of security council resolutions ( and (  the dominican republic maintains its position of unwavering friendship towards the peoples of that region  we do not believe that friendship with one of the countries of the region should result in discrimination against others  such friendship should not be criticized; no country should be criticized for being on friendly terms with either of the parties to the conflict, as sometimes happens when a country helps one of them in conclusion, i have not dealt with all of the important items on our agenda  i come from a small country, but one that has the good fortune to have a great president, mr  joaquin balaguer, whose modern conception of history enables him to be an insightful observer of the world scene  thus we feel solidarity with all the peoples represented here who bear the burden of many problems like ours  for that reason, my country will be represented wherever there are appeals for solidarity, respect, and efforts for peace  we wish to live in a world in which nations large and small may have equal opportunities for the benefit of their citizens, and the right to enjoy the resources we should all enjoy without discrimination our country has demonstrated that we have a stable democracy  in my country there are no political prisoners and no discrimination of any kind, religious or cultural  for this reason, our arms are open to all  because of our history and our language, we are a country of the caribbean and also a country of latin america  that is why we wish to serve as a bridge between the two americas so that peace may prevail in our continent  mr  henriquez ureña said that if ever the united nations general assembly had commenced its work in an atmosphere propitious to fruitful mutual collaboration it was on that occasion, when the world political horizon was again bright with hope  the general assembly was meeting in an atmosphere of tranquillity under the leadership of a distinguished statesman, general romulo, who could be described as the embodiment of the spirit of human kindness the task before the assembly was not easy, nothing was more arduous than the effort to reconcile conflicting ideologies and interests  good will, however, had power akin to faith, which moved mountains while the assembly agenda covered a vast number of topics, the political items, which occasioned the great differences, were not as numerous as in the past; moreover, they had all been discussed previously the question of the disposal of the former italian colonies was of primary importance  mr  henriquez ureña hoped the assembly would find an equitable and workable solution of the problem during that session; the position of the dominican republic thereon had already been clearly indicated and it would remain unchanged  any solution designed to ensure the preparation of those former colonies for selfgovernment or independence, through an orderly process carried out under the supervision of the united nations, would have the support of the delegation of the dominican republic the dominican republic maintained an equally firm attitude with regard to any problem involving respect for the independence and sovereignty of a state  for that reason it could not remain indifferent to another question which had already been debated in past sessions of the united nations general assembly, namely, the threat to the political independence and territorial integrity of greece  not only was the sacred principle of independence attacked by such threats but also another principle, that of nonintervention, which the american republics had embodied in many treaties and declarations the defence of those principles assumed a special importance in the case of greece, a country which occupied so high a place in the history of civilization through the farreaching influence of socrates, plato, aristotle, archimedes, aeschylus and anacreon, and the incomparable marble beauty of the mutilated venus of melos or the headless victory of samothrace was it unusual then if peoples whose culture had been nourished by the lifegiving stream of hellenic thought were united in their ardent desire to support and defend greece when her independence was at stake  on the altar of that great idea byron had laid down his life at missolonghi, and the soul of humanity had been filled with wonder when the people of greece, like david before goliath, had risen up to engage in unrelenting war with the invading hosts of fascism and nazism, as if from the depths of the past the martial and harmonious strains of the trytaean lyre had reechoed in their ears fortunately, it would appear that the problem of greece was approaching solution  there was ground for hope that normal, goodneighbourly relations would soon be reestablished between greece and adjacent nations in spite of the mutual accusations arising from regrettable incidents, the responsibility for which each of the contending countries ascribed to the other  the frontier incidents, however painful they might have been, were not the essence of the problem, but only one of its consequences  the assembly must go to the very heart of the question, and that could be done if all the parties concerned accepted the mediation of the united nations with the greatest good will in an effort to find an amicable solution a similar procedure had been successfully employed in dealing with the indonesian question which, although very different in substance and origin, offered a fine example of what could be accomplished by a spirit of good will  the parties concerned were discussing their problems under the aegis of the united nations and there was a good prospect that an agreement could be reached on principles which might well be a prelude to a final solution in respect to korea, the government of the dominican republic had recognized its existence as an independent nation  the delegation of the dominican republic considered that for the time being the united nations commission on korea, established for the purpose of cooperating in the solution of korean problems, and in the first place the problem of the country’s unification, should not be dissolved with regard to the questions that still awaited settlement in palestine, the delegation of the dominican republic expressed the firm belief that the protection of the holy places and free access thereto would be fully guaranteed in the assembly by means of a definitive agreement on the subject  it likewise believed that practical solutions would soon be found for the problem of the palestine refugees, to whose assistance the government of the dominican republic had already contributed from its resources just as it had contributed, and in no small measure, to other humanitarian undertakings of the united nations, such as the international children emergency fund the activity of the united nations in the economic and social fields had certainly been, and continued to be, very effective, although pessimists did not realize the full extent of the enormous work the organization was accomplishing, since they considered only the difficulties constantly arising in connexion with political questions  however, apart from the fact that the organization had, in more than one instance, achieved complete success in the political field and had settled more than one dispute which might have endangered world peace, the technical work it had accomplished, social as well as economic, juridical as well as cultural, was of inestimable value to humanity mr  henriquez ureña reviewed the achievements of the united nations in those fields: its action to promote the development of underdeveloped territories and technical assistance; the establishment of regional economic commissions for europe, asia, the far east and latin america; the establishment of vast and very useful services, such as the international statistical services; the holding of the united nations scientific conference on the conservation and utilization of natural resources  the united nations had effectively contributed to the improvement of the legal and social status of women  the general assembly, by its resolution (iii) of december  had promulgated the first international bill of human rights  by its resolution a (iii) of december it had approved the convention for the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide, a forward step of surpassing importance in the international field  the general assembly at its current session was to study another significant draft of vast social and juridical import, namely, the declaration of the rights and duties of states mr  henriquez ureña concluded by saying that his enumeration of some of the undertakings and achievements of the united nations was sufficient to indicate the great importance of the organization’s work and efforts, and justified the view that it represented the last and supreme hope of mankind  \\ufeffi address this general assembly griefstricken at the death of people in the tragicaviation accident yesterday in this city of new york most of the individuals stricken were, like myself, ofdominican nationality  our profound appreciation goesto the heads of state and government, to ministers andto representatives who have expressed theircondolences to the people and government of thedominican republic at this tragedy  i am much obligedto you, sir on behalf of the government of the dominicanrepublic i offer our congratulations to the president onhis election to the stewardship of this session of thegeneral assembly, convinced as we are that he willindeed succeed in guiding this session in the very bestinterests, and for the good, of the internationalcommunity  likewise, we offer our most heartfeltcongratulations to the secretarygeneral, mr  kofiannan, on his having been awarded the nobel peaceprize  that honour, together with that bestowed uponthe united nations, proves and ratifies the confidenceand recognition felt for the work being done by theinternational community represented in thisorganization on behalf of all mankind despite the fact that in september this year — onthe heels of the events of september in new yorkand in washington, d c  — the united nations devoteda number of plenary meetings to the issue of terrorism,it is still today impossible for us to separate this fromthe other items that we must deal with on the agenda ofthis session  the significance of these tragicdevelopments is of such magnitude that it is imperativefor us, as a matter of conscience, to stop and think ingreater depth about their complexity and theirrepercussions on the history that it is our lot to have tolive through, and about the most relevant ways for usto prevent and combat this scourge  that is so becauseit is plain to see that in the time that has elapsedbetween september and these days of november, wehave managed to go further and into greater depth,gaining new insights about the terrorist phenomenon we absolutely agree with those who have alreadyspoken that terrorism cannot be justified in any way,and that the excuses some would seek to advance tovalidate these deeds based on the existence of certaineconomic, social, cultural or political situations, areunacceptable  however paradoxical it may seem tosome, the conviction has also been stressed that, whileterrorism is unjustifiable and inexcusable, it is in thosevery situations where terrorism finds its breedinggrounds, where frustrations and lack of prospects canfan hatred and irrationality, where being shut out andhaving no hope, being shunted to the sidelines andsuffering from poverty can incubate and give birth andimpetus to twisted feelings of indiscriminate andirrational vengeance faced with the sad reality of the events of september just past, we are absolutely convinced thatthe direction set for us by the millennium summit wasthe right one, that is, the path of peace and offellowship among people  at that historic gathering therationale was analysed and the framework set foraction by the international community to promotehuman rights, security, disarmament, economicdevelopment, equality of nations, and the fight againsthunger, poverty, disease, exclusion, social, racial andgender prejudice, and the abandonment of children, thedisabled and the elderly  there can be no doubt thatthese are the priority objectives for the prevention ofviolence and crime, that is to say, for the struggleagainst wars, against genocide and against terrorism the full weight, pain and inhumanity of theprovocations of september must not divert us fromthe goals that we set for ourselves in the millenniumsummit declaration, nor draw us into anydisproportionate violence  when last month weaddressed this assembly we stated that the most prizedvirtue, indeed the democratic essence of thisorganization, that is of the united nations, is itscommitment and determination to uphold respect forhuman rights  it follows that although we know thatterrorism is the antithesis of that virtue, we must nottherefore act to confront it while failing to live up tothe obligation to protect those very rights  while actingin a legitimate reaction of selfdefence, we should notbe overcome by a spirit of retaliation but should ratherseek to apply international law and justice  that is whythe dominican republic cannot ignore the politicalmeasures that surely will also contribute to preventingand combating terrorism  thus, we must resolutelysupport security council resolution (,adopted on september, and feel ourselves alsobound by earlier resolutions and covenants the unitednations has worked out over time in its fight againstterrorism in the united nations charter highlighted asits core concern the need to preserve peace  that wasonly to be expected after a war that had brought deathto millions of human beings and had wreaked havoc inthe life of many nations  the time that has elapsed hasbrought us to the conviction that there is no better wayto preserve peace than to do all that we possibly can toprevent war  the united nations is ever morenecessary to attain that end, because within it we findthe underpinnings for promoting a healthy and creativeunderstanding among nations  our fidelity to thefoundations of the organization must be backed up bya shared political will leading to actions that proveirrefutably that we believe in and live up to what wesay and promise the unanimous adoption of the millenniumdeclaration, inasmuch as it represented a profoundcommitment by the vast majority of the world’sleaders, amounted to a kind of rebirth and renewal ofthe united nations in coming to grips with theproblems and challenges confronting us in the twentyfirst century  in that declaration it was decided to doall that we could to establish a just and lasting peace inaccordance with the purposes and principles of theunited nations charter, and the determination wasreaffirmed to support all efforts aimed at ensuring thesovereign equality of states, respect for their territorialintegrity and political independence and the right toselfdetermination of peoples that remain undercolonial domination and foreign occupation that pledge makes it incumbent upon us to bringour full moral force to bear and to avail ourselves of allpossibilities afforded us by the machinery of theorganization to resolve the conflicts that keep anumber of states around the globe in a state of war  wehave no doubt whatever that the conflict between israeland the palestinian state must come to an end viacompliance with the multiple resolutions towards thatend that have emanated from the general assembly,thus honouring what we agreed upon in thatmillennium declaration moreover, we set for ourselves the purpose ofspurring forward reform of the united nations charterand respecting the equality of the rights of nations ratifying the millennium declaration means that therecan be no delay in turning the security council into abody that would respond to the historic realities of thepresent world and in establishing a logical set ofdemocratic balances based on those realities  it seemsto us fair for the nonpermanent members to participatein the security council via a rotational system thatwould give to all the same opportunity  by the sametoken, the dominican republic believes that it is also amatter of equity and historical realism for us to acceptthe republic of china on taiwan as a member of theunited nations  geopolitical reasons must not overridesituations of fact that have been recognized in bringingother states into the united nations in the millennium declaration the problem ofglobalization was addressed with the following words:“we recognize that developing countriesand countries with economies in transition facespecial difficulties in responding to this centralchallenge  thus, only through broad andsustained efforts to create a shared future, basedupon our common humanity in all its diversity,can globalization be made fully inclusive andequitable ” (resolution  para  as we speak, a ministerial meeting of the countriesmembers of the world trade organization (wto) isbeing held in doha, qatar  most countries with smalleconomies are rightfully calling for the fulfilment of allthe agreements of the uruguay round  we hope thatthey will not be saddled with unbearable new burdens,that their calls will be heard and that generoussolidarity and cooperation will be shown, as well asunderstanding of the imbalances, differences andasymmetries in the pace of development whencomparing rich countries to poor, small ones among the objectives of the world tradeorganization are respect for human rights,strengthening democracy and preserving theenvironment  all that will not be possible if the processof globalization is not carried out with a sincere andresolute determination to show understanding and toprovide cooperation and technical assistance to helpthe majority of the nations on this planet to achievedevelopment  how are we to understand the deadlinesset by the world trade organization for attainingcertain economic objectives, in some cases as soon asand in others  when the millenniumdeclaration, aware of the inequalities and difficultiesfacing most nations, seeks to redress no sooner than— and only to a certain degree — the poverty ofmillions upon millions of human beings whose incomeis less than $a day  we hope that at the conferencesscheduled by the united nations, such as theinternational conference on financing fordevelopment and the world summit on sustainabledevelopment, light can be shed on these problems inan effective way, yielding equitable measures designedto reduce the inequalities separating peoples one fromthe other allow me finally to refer to an aspect mostintimately tied to respect for and recognition of humanrights, something that also coincides with themillennium declaration inasmuch as it refers to thedemands of women and gender equality  indeed, theinternational research and training institute for theadvancement of women (instraw), based in thedominican republic, is one of the few united nationsinstitutions located in a developing country, and theonly international institute devoted to research on andtraining for the advancement of women  the secretarygeneral, in his report to the general assemblypresented in the third committee on october said that, notwithstanding the difficulties anduncertainties that instraw has encountered in thelast two years it has managed to obtain the minimumresources for fulfilling the mandate assigned to it bythe assembly and the economic and social council he went on to say that inasmuch as the institutehas begun to produce tangible results via theinformation system and contact networks in creating anawareness of gender issues, perhaps the assemblywould wish to adopt a decision on how institute wouldbe able to operate productively and costeffectivelybeyond the year let us not let instraw — that noble institution,a pioneer in the advancement of women, particularly ofwomen in developing countries — perish for lack ofresources  let us make a consistent and generousgesture, demonstrating solidarity, so that the generalassembly will ensure the continued existence of thisinstitution beyond this year of  by allocating inthe united nations budget the funds necessary for it tocontinue to work towards its fruitful humanitarianends  eight years after switzerland became a full member of the united nations, we are delighted to see that the presidency of this general assembly at its sixtyfifth session fell to the president of the swiss confederation, mr  joseph deiss, to whom we wish the greatest success in his tenure   in  the twentieth special session of the general assembly was held to contribute to the elimination or substantial reduction of the illegal production of drugs and drug abuse by  ten years later, at a followup review meeting supported by this prestigious world body, the conclusion was reached that little progress had been made regarding the proposed goals and that there were therefore plenty of reasons for the international community to be concerned about the growing threat posed by the global drug problem  it was determined that a new year plan was needed to cover the period until  when the general assembly will have once again to convene member states in order to assess the outcome of measures implemented to eliminate the most serious threat to our citizens’ safety at the dawn of the twentyfirst century: transnational organized crime and illegal drug trafficking   today, almost million people between the ages of and consume drugs worldwide  although that consumption extends to many regions around the world, the highest concentration of users is found in areas with the most pronounced economic and social development, such as the united states, western europe and central asia   drug consumption is harmful to health, causing personality disorders that often lead to loss of will, apathy and the development of pathological behaviour  furthermore, tens of thousands of people die every year as a direct result of drug consumption, while others, depending on the way these toxic substances are consumed, are affected by diseases such as hiv/aids and hepatitis c   today, illegal drug trafficking constitutes a global black market, a kind of underground or hidden economy for the growth, manufacture, distribution and sale of this merchandise in the form of marijuana, opium, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamines and other varieties of such substances and others  that market, which is ruled like any other by the laws of supply and demand, now amounts to the astronomical sum of approximately $billion a year  that astronomical sum means that the global drug trade is worth more than the gross domestic product of of the countries that appear on the annual world bank economic index  every year, the global drug market generates more wealth than countries such as chile, denmark, egypt, finland, israel, south africa and portugal  but, at the same time, it is more economically powerful than many of the world’s leading petroleum producing countries such as kuwait, qatar, iraq, the united arab emirates and the bolivarian republic of venezuela   in pursuit of its goals of conquering markets and accumulating wealth, transnational organized crime has begun availing itself of a new type of unprecedented, inhumane and cruel violence  drug trafficking uses kidnapping, contract killings, torture and beheadings both in battles between drug trafficking groups and against the people and institutions that confront them  drug trafficking sows fear and terror  it executes public servants as well as ordinary citizens  it murders journalists, teachers, doctors, students and housewives  drug trafficking knows no limits or borders; it knows only horror, barbarism, bloodshed and crime   it is so powerful that it influences and interferes in vital areas of government, such as the armed forces, the police, intelligence services and the justice system, in its attempt to make state institutions serve its macabre and sinister interests       in the face of all of this, some people are right to wonder whether transnational organized crime and illegal international drug trafficking can be defeated  is it really possible to tackle and defeat all that this form of international crime entails   our response is: yes, it is possible  it is possible to take it on and to defeat it  it is possible to reduce it and to mitigate its harmful effects  however, to do so, several elements need to be in place  first, we need genuine commitment at the global level and authentic and genuine political will at the level of national government   we also need a paradigm change or a new strategic vision that will focus our efforts to fight the problem, not only on the supply side, as has fundamentally been the case so far, but also on the demand and consumption side    it is imperative that we curb indiscriminate gun sales and human trafficking  we need to implement exchange and cooperation policies among the narcotics producer, transit and consumer countries  we need to introduce new technologies, strengthen intelligence systems, better train and enhance the professionalism of those in charge of ensuring public safety, design prevention mechanisms, generate educational opportunities, reduce poverty and create jobs, and get communities involved in building protective networks against crime   we hope that, in  when the general assembly convenes its member states to evaluate the outcome of its new year plan of action on international cooperation towards an integrated and balanced strategy to counter the world drug problem (see resolution , we will be in a position to say, for the sake of our families, our young people, our societies and, ultimately, of humanity as a whole, “we have prevailed  we have defeated the leading threat to the security our peoples at the beginning of the twentyfirst century  we have beaten drugs ”  it is important also to note that the human and material losses experienced as a result of natural disasters in are a great cause for concern  to date, we have seen floods and landslides, affecting countries as far apart as india and brazil, china and colombia, russia and congo, kazakhstan and countries of east africa, mexico and central america, pakistan, yemen and the sudan   to date, there have been hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons, affecting countries such as mexico, india, the solomon islands and madagascar  to date, we have suffered eight serious droughts, followed by fires, in bolivia, california, the caribbean, china, spain and russia  to date, there have been seven earthquakes, from the tragedy in haiti to china, from tajikistan to chile, and from afghanistan to mexico   that does not include the volcanic eruptions — these too made no distinction between rich and poor  in the case of iceland, the volcano led to the most serious interruption of air traffic since the second world war  in addition, we need to take into account the numerous cold snaps, avalanches and storms that have occurred and their resultant epidemics — foremost among them, cholera in africa and dengue fever in latin america and the caribbean   as we can see, vulnerability to natural disasters around the world is on the rise, and development levels are falling quickly as a result  most of these natural disasters are caused by climate change or global warming  it is therefore imperative that this world body adopt, as soon as possible, guidelines to regulate the emission of carbon dioxide and to protect the planet’s biodiversity   there is much work to be done around the world to draw up and adopt policies and practices that will enable us to prevent the impact of natural disasters  in this context, it is crucial to incorporate risk management into development and landuse planning  we need to design and implement early warning systems in coastal areas, cities at risk, schools and hospitals  and we need urgently to reequip critical infrastructure to ensure that it is adequate to withstand future catastrophes and to minimize human loss  faced with this situation, the dominican republic intends to participate actively in the work of the global platform for disaster risk reduction, whose next meeting will take place in geneva, switzerland, in may   likewise, with advisory assistance from the united nations development programme and new york’s columbia university, in october we will be meeting with the ministers responsible for social policy as well as the mayors of cities at greatest risk in order to review ongoing activities in the integration and planning of natural disaster risk management   finally, i would like to take this opportunity to suggest, as we did during a visit to l’aquila, italy, that    the united nations system create a world alliance of countries at risk in order to exchange experiences, knowledge and ideas, and to pass along best practices learned during catastrophes  we are convinced that this would be a major contribution to the design and implementation of measures that will help save lives and minimize material damage  i should like first to convey to you, mr  president, the dominican delegation warmest congratulations on your election as president of the thirteenth session of the united nations general assembly  the breadth of your culture, your long experience in the united nations and your personal identification with the great causes under debate here, fully justify your election and are a guarantee that the course of our debates will be wisely directed reaffirming its faith in the united nations, the dominican republic takes part in the work of this thirteenth session of the general assembly in order to combine its efforts with those of all states which are sincerely seeking, through the practice of the principles and methods advocated by the united nations, the best solution to the urgent problems which are at present threatening the peace, security and wellbeing of the international community my government firmly believes in the fundamental purpose of this organization, to whose creation it contributed as a charter member of the great alliance formed on january  while the struggle was being waged on the battlefields of europe and the far east for those same principles of freedom and the independence of nations which are now being debated amid the anguish and dangers of the cold war in accordance with the guiding principles of dominican foreign policy, the dominican government has pursued a course of staunch support for the united nations  this is demonstrated by our collaboration in the organization’s collective security programmes and, more particularly, in those which are inspired by a genuine sense of human solidarity, such as the programmes concerned with refugees, child relief and technical assistance, to which we have contributed with a generosity and regularity which have already become proverbial the interval between the twelfth and the thirteenth sessions of the general assembly has been one of the most anxious times in the history of the united nations, the expansionist forces of international communism, faced with the western powers' policy  of containment, have once again embarked upon a political manoeuvre comparable to the advance and withdrawal of the ocean waves and having the same effect of subterranean erosion, endangering as it does the defence of international peace and security we have witnessed an exchange of mutually recriminatory letters, which has vividly illustrated the clash between the two opposing points of view; charges have been brought without substantiation and the same subterfuges and sophistries have been brought out time and again, in the apparent belief that the nations witnessing this unedifying spectacle have short memories  this display of barren diplomatic exchanges is proof positive of the need to maintain the system of regional alliances provided for by the charter at the highest level of effectiveness and unity of thought and action but what is the real significance of these associations for collective security  alliances do not rest solely upon networks of bases and the mere interchange of material and equipment  it is essential to bear in mind the spiritual factors involved, for it is those factors which constitute the active principle holding them together  the word alliance signifies mutual respect, sincere friendship, a genuine readiness to afford mutual help and a deep understanding between the parties pledging their respective strength and resources the ideological conflict which developed in international relations during the period i have mentioned is not, however, confined to a sharp tactical contest on the diplomatic front  the wide disparities in economic development on the present international scene have given international communism a broad avenue for ideological and political penetration, and an opportunity for competition which is fraught with such implications for the future that concerted efforts of the widest and most vigorous kind are required to eliminate these disparities and to direct the fight against want, ignorance and disease along the only acceptable ideological lines, namely those defined at the beginning of chapter ix of the charter economic and social cooperation may not be used as an instrument of political penetration or of intervention in the affairs of states  it must serve only the ends prescribed by the charter, which stipulates that social progress and the raising of standards of living must conform to a more ample concept of freedom and that the creation of conditions of stability necessary for peaceful and friendly relations must be based on respect for the principle of equal rights and selfdetermination of peoples the vital need to mobilize resources of capital and technical knowledge and to secure steadily improved conditions for the international exchange of goods and services in order to better the social and economic situation of the underdeveloped countries is confronting the americas with an extremely painful dilemma, which cannot go unheeded by american statesmen  either we yield to the blandishments of those who seek to draw the american economy into the orbit of that economic policy which governed by tire principles of dialectical materialism and the class struggle transposed to the sphere of international relations, with all the unforeseeable consequences which a progressive trend in that direction might have, or we accept the challenge to establish in the americas economic and social institutions of the kind required for the purposes of collective security against aggression and the peaceful settlement of international disputes,we share the conviction of those who believe that the historical community of the american nations has sufficient moral and material resources to develop in our continent, in accordance with our traditions based upon western christian philosophy, an outstanding example of international cooperation for the purposes of chapter ix of the charter we are faced, and this should be stressed again, with a real challenge to the future of interamerican solidarity  just as at the conferences of havana in , montevideo in and buenos aires in , we succeeded in overcoming the dangerous indecision which was vitiating continental policy towards certain practices incompatible with the principles of the independence and sovereignty of states, and again reaffirmed the principle of nonintervention; and just as, at the conferences at petropolis in and at bogota in  we established rules for collective security and the peaceful settlement of disputes which are an example to the rest of the world, it is now time for us to go beyond the stage of oratorical statements and of reservations inconsistent with the principles of economic and social cooperation which we claim to support, and to overcome the frustrations which attended the abortive economic agreement of bogota, the meeting of ministers of finance in and the economic conference in buenos aires in  in order to set up a vigorous and effective system of economic and social cooperation the dominican republic shares to the full the anxieties which beset the american continent and which have placed the solution of the serious economic and social problems of the americas in the forefront of public concern  the dominican republic, with a territory of square kilometres and a population of inhabitants, now offers, owing to the programme of political, social and economic rehabilitation introduced by generalissimo trujillo in  the spectacle of a nation which is achieving its rightful aspirations within the american community of nations yet, twentyeight years ago the situation in the dominican republic offered one of the most depressing examples of economic and social underdevelopment  our nation was plagued by internal upheavals which precluded any attempt at civilization and culture and threatened to place us outside the ranks of the civilized nations,during the early decades of this century, it became obvious that we must eliminate periods of social depression and embark upon a programme of national rehabilitation  we had to give force and meaning to our constitutional provisions which defined the dominican republic as a democratic and representative state, based upon the sovereignty of the people and on the fulfilment of certain essential human rights up to our constitutional history was one of disharmony between the principles proclaimed by our institutions and the underlying economic and social facts  that being so, it was impossible for us to contribute in any way to international cooperation  the limits of our national territory were still undefined owing to the failure to solve the ageold frontier problem; our financial system had collapsed, bringing us to the verge of bankruptcy and anarchy; and our people were decimated by diseases which sapped their productive capacity and were deprived of the most elementary educational and cultural facilities, surviving precariously in a primitive economy  in those circumstances, it was clear that our government, if it was to salvage the nation, was faced with the exceptional task of breathing life into the shadow of an almost vanished state and society our territorial boundaries were fixed by the frontier agreement of and the gradual economic, social and cultural development brought about by the various governments which have ruled the country under the same continuing political leadership has made possible such results as the following  in the country entire public health budget was no more than $ today the budget of this important government service is some $ it has thus multiplied more than fifty times  whereas in we had eight hospitals with beds, we now have fiftyone hospitals with beds, some of the hospitals having a greater capacity than all the hospitals in the country together in  the malaria eradication programme is reaching a decisive phase, with a marshalling of health resources never before seen in our history our social policy protecting the working classes is reflected not only in our accession to the more important international labour organisation conventions but also in the incorporation of the standards laid down in these conventions in our own labour legislation  our minimum wage regulations are at present being amended in accordance with a plan recommended by the united nations expanded programme of technical assistance, the objective being to ensure that the level of wages of the lowerpaid working classes rises gradually in step with the expansion of the national economy and thus to preclude inflationary pressures or disturbances likely to make the continuous operation of undertakings uneconomic  among the more important social security advances is legislation introducing compulsory life insurance for all civil servants and government employees earning less than $a month one interesting item in cur legislation for the protection of the needy classes is act no   promulgated in  which provides for the payment of state allowances to the children of persons serving prison sentences, if they are without means of subsistence the dominican republic achievements in the sphere of education clearly demonstrate that government activities in our country are firmly rooted definitely and unquestionably in the people  in order to give a rough indication of the growth of education in the republic in recent years i need only mention that, whereas the population has doubled in the last twentytwo years, primary schools have multiplied their capacity eleven times during the same period  altogether, pupils are enrolled at schools in urban and rural areas; adolescents are attending secondary schools and are undergoing training in vocational schools, while young people are receiving higher education at our university  the most spectacular effort has been the trujillo universal literacy campaign, whose effectiveness can be judged by the fact that whereas the illiteracy figure in was per cent, it has now fallen to per cent  there was, therefore, every justification for the statement made by mr  barón castro, in addressing the third latin american education congress at ciudad trujillo in january  on behalf of the executive board of the united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization that illiteracy had shown a lightning decline in the dominican republic  this year the republic education budget will be more than $million, which is a higher figure than that of the country entire budget before the year the extent of the republic economic progress can be estimated from its agricultural production and industrial development  as a result of the advances made in both these areas, the per caput income of the republic has risen in from $to $ this result has been secured through an exceptional increase in the area under cultivation; national production for export, the value of which in did not exceed $million a year, in reached the highest figure in the country history — $million with regard to industry, as a result of the government policy of stimulating development, there were, in  industrial establishments representing a total invested capital of more than $million  economic development policy is based on the provision of absolute guarantees for domestic and foreign capital investments great advances have been made in the electrification of the country since this source of power was nationalized  the government has invested $million in the development of hydroelectricinstallations  between and the country consumption of electricity rose to million kilowatthours, the increase in alone being kilowatts one of the government largest undertakings at present, under the programme for the electrification of the entire country and for the improvement of the irrigation system, which has given such an impetus to agricultural development in the republic, is the building of the tavera dam which, when completed, will irrigate hectares and will have a capacity of million cubic metres of water  this project is being financed entirely by dominican capital this mobilization of the country natural resources and manpower in  order to ensure a steady increase in the rate of economic and social development of the dominican people is best reflected in the dominican government fiveyear plan, launched on august  which calls for the investment of some $million in economic development and in the expansion of health and educational services as the dominican republic economy is primarily an export economy, the rate of our economic development depends very largely on tire existence of favourable terms of trade  the government of the dominican republic will cooperate to the utmost in the execution of plans already drawn up for the socalled operation panamerican, but it considers that this programme should also provide for the elimination of certain restrictive agreements resulting in discrimination against the dominican republic most important export product in the united states market  my government feels that there should be no permanent quota restrictions which discriminate against certain countries  this is a problem which affects not only the dominican republic but also the great majority of latin american countries exporting agricultural and mineral raw materials; it is, therefore, a problem of general concern, and should be included in any programme designed to bring about a real interamerican economic unity the delegation of the dominican republic earnestly hopes that the united nations will not disappoint the hopes mankind has placed in it and that, during the present session, we shall be able to make a real and constructive contribution to the easing of international tension and come to realize — even those of us who see international relations as a dialectical process — that one of the most absurd contradictions and one which we all have an equal duty to seek to resolve is the paradox of a world becoming increasingly interdependent, yet at the same time driven by fears, antagonisms and rivalries absorbing energies which should rather be directed towards raising the general standard of living of all peoples  \\ufeffi wish to extend ourcongratulations to mr  jan kavan on his election tolead the work of the general assembly  we areconfident that his leadership will bring greater honourto the united nations, to his country and to himself we would also like to congratulate his predecessor, mr han seungsoo, for his excellent work during theprevious session we would also like to express our solidarity withsecretarygeneral kofi annan in his defence of thewill of the many in the face of any event that placesworld peace at risk we also wish to welcome the swissconfederation and east timor as they take their placesin the organization on behalf of the people and the government ofthe dominican republic, i would like once again toreiterate the profound faith that the dominican peoplehave in the principles on which the universal missionof the united nations is based  the ideas andambitions that sparked the second world war broughthumanity close to losing all hope for peaceful coexistence  political fanaticism, intransigent nationalismand all sorts of prejudices cast their shadow overleaders and over a great part of the world, leading to anominous undertaking whose ideological manifestationgreatly endangered the freedom and cultural diversityof humankind luckily for all, reason prevailed  in order to makethat victory a lasting one, and in order to ensure thathumankind would maintain a steady and clear pathtowards peace, the nations who fought for freedomrecognized the need to create a body to watch over thevalues that would improve international behaviour these were the reasons for both the emergence of theunited nations and for enshrining in the charter theobjectives of peace, justice, the rejection of aggressionand the resolution of controversies through peacefulmeans and in accordance with international law in other words, it was very clearly set out that theorganization would seek to use every peaceful meansto resolve conflicts between peoples or states  it wasalso clearly specified that the use of force to maintainor restore peace and international security had to be theresult of a unanimous decision of the permanentmembers of the security council  over five decadeshave passed since the establishment of theorganization, and the events and changes experiencedby the world in that time have been innumerable many bloody conflicts in the middle east, asiaand africa have challenged the authority of the unitednations  many unilateral actions have violated theorganization legal system and threatened the balanceof the world  nevertheless, despite every provocationand all the instances of noncompliance with theresolutions of its highest bodies, the organization hasclearly made its mark by asserting the need to respectthe international norms and laws governing thebehaviour of its members  peace, and even the survivalof mankind itself, owe a great deal to the achievementsof the united nations unfortunately, threats to universal peace continueto cast their shadow over the world today  the date ofseptember is an alarming example of thescope and capability of the enemies of peace  we willnever be able to forget the perversity of those actions,their criminal character or the affront they tried toinflict upon this great nation  we understand perfectlywell that, in the face of an aggression of this nature, thespontaneous reaction may be that of claiminglegitimate selfdefence  however, we should agree thatsuch a response has moral limitations and conditionsembodied in the principles that rule the rights of peopleand in those that form the bedrock of this organization the dominican government has been signing allresolutions, agreements and conventions againstterrorism  the dominican government has supportedsecurity council resolution (, which createdthe counterterrorism committee, and is promotingthe work to draft a comprehensive convention againstinternational terrorism  however, our purpose infighting this scourge and our solidarity with the nationsthat have been and are its victims must be focused,beyond any contingency, on the eradication of thecauses that stimulate and provoke the depravation ofthe human condition that is expressed in acts of terror with regard to the right to confront terrorismdirectly, we must be aware that unilateral actionrepresents a defeat of our capacity to reach agreements it is only logical that it is our responsibility to do sowith all the authority that this organization grantsthrough its multilateral nature  this is true because theuse of force can be justified only when all means underthe charter of united nations available to the generalassembly and the security council to assess the existenceof a real threat to world peace have been exhausted in his report of april concerning theissue of peace in africa, the secretarygeneral set forthideas which must serve as a guide on the iraqisituation  among other ideas, kofi annan stated:“for the united nations there is no highergoal, no deeper commitment and no greaterambition than preventing armed conflict  theprevention of conflict begins and ends with thepromotion of human security and humandevelopment ” (a/ para  it is obvious that we are not the only ones to thinkthat, in the face of market globalization processes, culturalexchanges, technologies and communications, it hasbecome imperative to resume on the path laid down atthe millennium summit in order to correct the imbalancesand to halt the growing total marginalization of largesectors of the world population  allow me to quote aparagraph from the millennium declaration as areminder of our priorities:“we believe that the central challenge weface today is to ensure that globalization becomesa positive force for all the world people  forwhile globalization offers great opportunities, atpresent its benefits are very unevenly shared,while its costs are unevenly distributed  werecognize that developing countries and countrieswith economies in transition face specialdifficulties in responding to this centralchallenge ” (resolution  para  moreover, the millennium summit prioritizedissues such as poverty, illiteracy, illness, genderinequality and environmental depletion as causes thatconspire decisively against peace and universalcoexistence  these troubling situations beg thequestion: how much have we done at the national andinternational levels to eliminate the obstacles thathinder the growth of the developing countries right from its assumption of power in august the government of the dominican republic,headed by agronomist hipólito mej'a, has taken aseries of measures aimed at adapting legislation in bothpublic and private institutions to the demands of theunavoidable globalization process  with respect tosocial reform, the dominican government haslaunched a programme to reduce poverty and hasincreased its support in the fight against illiteracy  thecreation of ministries of women and the environmentare also significant initiatives in view of the lack ofattention from which these sectors of societytraditionally suffered we know that other countries have made similarchanges, but the truth of the matter is that, as a whole,global statistics leave little room for optimism whencompared to those relating to the great majority ofdeveloping countries  unfortunately, at the globallevel, we cannot say that developed countries havemanifested any understanding of or solidarity towardsthese issues in positive terms  the opportunitiesoffered by the developed countries for developingcountries to participate in the globalization processthrough cooperation leading to harmonious, gradualand equitable adaptation leave much to be desired within this sombre picture, the united nations hasto act decisively in favour of the development of nationsunjustifiably constrained by protectionism and subsidies,which create barriers that hinder competition on equalterms and which, consequently, negate free trade year after year, speaker after speaker, we speak inthis solemn hall about the mandate — also ratified atthe millennium summit — to proceed with decisivereforms in the security council and the generalassembly  however, a sort of indifference or adversepurport postpones or paralyses the opportunity toactually undertake such reform  if the universalconscience is to enjoy genuine representation, thereform of such bodies is imperative  thus, thisorganization needs its multilateral role to become thetrue expression of the political composition acquiredby the world over the past years on behalf of the dominican government, wewish to express our satisfaction for the decision takenby the organization of american states regardinghaiti  indeed, through its resolution of 4september  entitled “support for strengtheningdemocracy in haiti”, that regional organization decidedto support the regularization of economic cooperationbetween the haitian government and internationalfinancial institutions  following the instructions of thepresident of the dominican republic, we appeal to theconscience of the united nations to proceed in thesame manner and to extend its support in reachingthose nations capable of generous cooperation with oursister nation i wish to take this opportunity to share the mostrecent decisions concerning the international researchand training institute for the advancement of women,headquartered in the dominican republic, which is one ofthe few united nations bodies located in a developingcountry and the only one working on women researchand training  on december  by resolution the general assembly decided to create aworking group with the mandate to makerecommendations on the future work of the institute  thatworking group met eight times in july and august the dominican republic is confident that this sessionof the general assembly will accept the workinggroup recommendations and that the institute willsoon be able to continue to fulfil its mandate in conclusion, i must recall that, at the beginningof my statement, i reaffirmed the faith of the dominicanpeople and government in the mission of the unitednations  this organization is more necessary today thanever before, at a time when the world is shrinking andwhen we increasingly need more than one interlocutorto which we can turn when faced with issues that couldprovoke violence and war  in other words, today morethan ever all nations aspire to having an organizationthat, through its traditional mandate and its universalscope, can strike a balance among all states for thebenefit of genuine democratic security  i am honoured to address the general assembly on behalf of the people and the government of the dominican republic  at the outset, i would like to apologize on behalf of mr  danilo madina sánchez, president of the dominican republic, for his absence from the debate, as he has had to return to our country to deal with hurricane maria our meeting this week coincides with the devastating season of natural disasters that our region has been enduring for nearly a month with terrible consequences  the disasters have also spread to mexico, which has been hit by two destructive earthquakes, and the southern united states, viciously punished by hurricane harvey  in the catalogue of human suffering caused by hurricane irma, that of antigua and barbuda stands out, particularly barbuda, per cent of whose infrastructure has collapsed, according to its prime minister, gaston browne  hardly had irma’s devastating winds dropped than maria arrived, leaving a new trail of destruction and death, inflicting a direct hit first on dominica and today on its neighbour puerto rico, causing great destruction and damage we take this opportunity to express our solidarity with puerto rico, which is also our neighbour, as well as with all the countries affected  the people of the dominican republic offer their deepest sympathy for the destruction and the large numbers of victims  accurate figures for the damage done on saint barthélemy, saint maarten, anguilla, the virgin islands, tortola, turks and caicos, puerto rico, the dominican republic and especially florida and cuba, have yet to be determined  however, we can say that they have suffered substantial damage, that recovery will take years and that, tragically, valuable lives have been lost to give member states an idea of how severely we have been affected, despite the lack of definitive figures, i can say that the material losses caused by this hurricane season alone far exceed the gross domestic product of the dominican republic  we often focus on material damage and ignore the human suffering caused by such disasters, whose lethal power has been aggravated by climate change  the statistics are striking, but they cannot reflect the pain of the victims, their desolation at seeing so much work ruined and so many efforts, visions and dreams lost  it is not just houses that have been lost, it is homes  material damage has been done, but above all, lives have been shattered we must recognize the inherent dangers of climate change, which are far more significant in the context of the geography of the caribbean  our economies, our way of life and our potential for development are in jeopardy  the vulnerability of the caribbean and of the dominican republic poses a risk that we cannot face alone  while our country was fortunate enough not to suffer human losses during the recent passage of hurricane irma, we are aware that, like every caribbean island, we will always be vulnerable to this type of phenomenon that reality impels us to once again draw the assembly’s attention to the crucial importance of joining forces to confront such threats  it compels us to act in a responsible and united way to defend the lives of our people  and i would like to be extremely clear on this point  the messages of solidarity and the humanitarian aid that always follow such disasters are not enough  nor is it enough to sign agreements on climate change  there is an urgent and critical need to act coherently on those agreements in order to advance a united agenda and set concrete plans in motion we are facing a growing problem that knows no borders and requires the cooperation and solidarity of all of us, but especially the most developed and most powerful countries  we are facing a reality that will oblige us to act as responsibly as we can if we do not want to go on lamenting the consequences  that is why my country is once again proposing to the assembly that we create a special fund for dealing with this type of disaster and for prevention and early warning, which will help us save lives  if we want to see an example of how economic resources can help to mitigate the damage done by natural phenomena, we need only look at the united states  after the most recent hurricanes, its government, which has the necessary resources, immediately made $billion available for rebuilding its affected states, thereby providing its citizens with the help they needed  conversely, there is no way that vulnerable areas such as the island region of the caribbean can cope with the devastation that such phenomena inflict on our peoples and countries as an example, take my own country, the dominican republic  this year, natural phenomena in the form of rains and floods have damaged thousands of kilometres of highways and roads, resulting in substantial losses  dozens of bridges have collapsed and miles of retaining walls and irrigation canals have been destroyed  thousands of acres of mixed farmland that are vital to keeping our people fed every day have been lost  in addition, among much other damage, hundreds of homes have been destroyed, not counting those hit by hurricane irma  we have spent more than $million on rescue and relief operations just in the past few months we are therefore concerned about the fact that similar, or even more powerful, events resulting from climate change have the potential to set the development of ours and other caribbean countries back years  i am talking about snatching away a whole people’s happiness and prospects for the future  that is not something we can continue to take lightly  it is in that context that the work of the united nations and the solidarity between our countries make most sense on behalf of all the men, women, children and elderly people who are utterly desperate right now, i urge all of us to seek ways for the united nations to support governments that cannot cope on their own in rebuilding their countries in the wake of natural disasters  let us take the necessary steps to make that aid available and ensure that it reaches those in desperate need  it is part of our responsibility as brother nations  i would also like to call on the countries of the united nations to reflect anew, and urgently, on what we must do in order to counteract extreme climate events  the scientific evidence for the relationship between natural disasters, manmade change and global warming is quite sufficient  it is time for us to play our part and act to slow down events, or the future will judge us for our total lack of responsibility since the organization was founded, years ago, our country has been a member of the unique experience in the history of humankind that is its creation  since then, the united nations has been a beacon pointing the way to a future of hope  we must never fall into complacency on that road  we know that essential aspects of our civilization, such as peace, security and development, are not gifts that drop from the sky  they are not something that we can take for granted  they are the result of a commitment between our peoples that must be constantly renewed and that we must keep working for  the dominican republic is fully committed to that vision and to the search for comprehensive solutions to the challenges facing the international community  we are determined to contribute energetically to building an evermore democratic, participatory and effective united nations to help solve our peoples’ real problems  mr  president, it was a source of great pleasure for me to see you elected to preside over the twentyfifth session of the general assembly at a time when our organization has recorded in the pages of history the twentyfifth anniversary of its founding in san francisco when it was set up to guide the destiny of the peoples members of the organization and serve as a repository for the principles for the maintenance and preservation of the peace and progress that our civilization demands the election which has led to your being chosen to preside over this assembly a very wise choice indeed is a tribute to your great country, which has contributed to the development of the history of free nations a tradition of peace that serves as an example for the legal community that we constitute a country which has always commanded respect and admiration from all corners of the earth  your election is also a tribute of recognition and respect rendered to your wisdom, your qualities as a statesman and your devotion to the cause defended by the nations assembled in this world organization  under your enlightened and experienced guidance we are sure that the assembly will embark upon a session which in and of itself is of great importance because of the tremendous tasks confronting all delegations, the significance of the anniversary that is coming up shortly and because here, as never before, a spirit of understanding and coexistence should prevail above all momentary considerations so that we may inaugurate a new phase in international law under the most auspicious circumstances  we are duty bound to display this spirit because of the wisdom, the experience and the maturity which we have gained during twentyfour regular sessions of the general assembly, sessions which have led us to the point where we will be commemorating this exceptional event very shortly in solemn ceremony and celebration it is, therefore, an honor for my delegation to convey to you our good wishes on your election and we are sure that your wisdom will enlighten and guide our thinking and our decisions during the discharge of the mandate that we have received from our respective governments during the holding of the twentyfourth regular session of the general assembly the dominican republic, in a desire to contribute in some way to the historic importance of the session upon which we are just embarking, conveyed to the secretarygeneral an expression of our desire that as part of the methodology of the specific question of a new reform of the united nations charter we should include consideration of the right of veto in the security council and the powers enjoying that right, the apolitical status of outer space and the right of new small states to be admitted to the world organization twentyfive years after the founding of the united nations we cannot fail to recognize the changes that have occurred in the world of today in all essential aspects and, most particularly, with respect to international life upon the emergence of new states, all of which makes it incumbent upon us to find new formulae to bring the constituent principles of the organization up to date taking into account the experience gained over a quarter of a century and the ideals that justify its existence we all recall very clearly the debates that developed in connexion with article of the charter of the united nations  i refer to the right of veto which was accepted finally in the form in which it now appears in the charter we must recognize the fact that after the last world war and mankind is still suffering its residual effects statesmen wanted to lay unshakable foundations for the maintenance and preservation of peace in the world but none the less, the spirit of war had an impact on the solutions involving the interests of the victorious states  that situation was most typical among the great powers  i venture to believe that that cause and no other, taken together with a need to find a substitute for the classical system of alliances to maintain international equilibrium, predominated in the deliberations that finally led to the provision of the veto in the security council there seems no doubt that to a considerable degree the veto has fulfilled the objective for which it was created, despite the frequent exercise of this right by the states that possess the veto  but the facts tend to show that if on some occasions this tool has proved useful to avoid greater evils, it is equally certain that in other instances the frequency with which this exceptional right has been exercised, a right which is discriminatory in the light of the principles of democracy, has come to constitute an obstacle to the progress that the united nations should have attained in achieving the purposes for which it was set up this modem age, with the present stage of development of space science and the achievements of man through his journeys to the moon, has created a new individual and collective mentality, and we should admit this now  the states that make up our organization are not immune to the impact of this new mentality however, we cannot deny that man is just as imperfect as he was on the first day of his creation, but it is obvious that, like civilizations, generations move and are transformed in accordance with the immutable laws of human progress for this reason the fundamental instrument which governs us cannot have failed to feel the impact of these uncontrollable pressures  hence we find the reason justifying the need for reforms of the principles which, until the past decade, and particularly if we look back twentyfive years, were appropriate to mitigate the imperfections of international life and the conflicts that it has been possible to confine to certain areas of the world without allowing these conflicts to involve the members of the organization in a new total warlike adventure where the last word would be had by those who had predominance in nuclear weapons that are capable of wiping out every vestige of human life and civilization from the face of the earth accordingly, on the occasion of this important assembly, concern about the veto has cropped up once again  it might be said that recently an awareness of the veto has been developed that has come to be expressed by certain radical manifestations, as in 'he  case of brazil which has set forth the criterion that the veto should be prohibited if we wish to preserve the united nations from the decadence likely to lead to its final dissolution our country initiative would constitute a step forward in this direction  it pays tribute to the law of nature that does not proceed by leaps and bounds, and at the same time it is in accordance with the proven experience that the life of nations and of men develops in accordance with a process of evolution that cannot nor should not be violated, subject to the penalty of retreating in a move backward to previous positions or a position marking a step even further back for that reason we are advocating a solution which moves between the enshrinement of the division of the veto with the feature of one veto for two votes or for the adoption of a quota of vetoes  if circumstances would permit, this would be the position we would take if we agreed to revise the charter the legal rules that constitute the body of law governing outer space would be incomplete if they did not rest upon a fundamental rule drawn from the notion of the apolitical status of space, the area in which those rules should be applied and respected  we are dealing here with such a new and sensitive international contribution as the idea of jurisprudence to apply to outer space  in this exceedingly new field we shall certainly have to grapple with great difficulties, periods of stagnation and experiences, and we will have to exercise the utmost wisdom in coping with this task  in the light of the strictest provisions of the charter it will also be essential to think above all of the survival of the human race in the face of the dangers inherent in the conquest of the vast reaches of the stars with these concerns in mind, and convinced as we are that the progress of technology in respect of the conquest of outer space is proceeding at a dizzy pace, we have sketched out our concern which might seem a bit sudden if it were not for the fact that we are already confronted with inescapable facts and realities in referring as we have to the fact that outer space should be considered as apolitical in this twenty fifth session of the general assembly  we have made these comments because we are desirous of contributing by this expression of our goodwill to the celebration of a quarter of a century of the united nations the advent of new, smaller states to independent international life has been the subject of speculation and informal public statements which may perhaps have created a degree of confusion in certain international quarters, and even prejudices that can mislead the public conscience  the reaction that has been produced, as was logical to assume, has sometimes led to the possibility of people thinking somewhat lightly of how far we can go in weakening the legal equality of states by a system of restrictions if this idea were to gain a little more currency, it would foster various prejudices harmful to our organization and could eventually perhaps in some way undermine people confidence in the raison d'etre of this organization, an organization that we should defend firmly against all obstacles that may to a greater or lesser degree affect its necessary development in the interest of maintaining the legal order free from discrimination of any kind obviously, we should foresee events and prevent the abnormalities that may affect our organization  in that manner we will preserve the legacy of experience that we, the peoples that make up this organization, have garnered here after two and a half decades of what has often been stormy activity which an organization which has met the tests to which it has been subjected up until this great moment in history accordingly, it would be appropriate for us to look forward to the situation that may arise in connexion with the admission of new smaller states  we believe that, with this approach, we can find workable solutions, so that when we come to deal with a problematical or contentious case, we can find the way out which will meet the facts of the case, without destroying the principle of the legal equality of states my delegation has always supported the principles of political decolonization and the right to self determination of peoples, which have been given concrete expression under the aegis of the united nations  we have kept this position and we shall continue to do so, convinced as we are that this provision contained in the constitution of this organization is in accordance with the most appropriate procedure for forming the national conscience of the people so favored, and to ensure that the transitional period towards the highest degree of selfgovernment can achieve at least a minimum level of efficiency, in order that it may enjoy lasting status within the international legal community but, together with political decolonization, we would also like to see, concomitantly, the idea of economic decolonization, which is possible only if the states members of our organization share the idea of economic interdependence, which is becoming more and more pressing for the same reasons for which we pay homage in this world of today to the principle of the interdependence of states  we should strengthen this edifice without it being necessary to distinguish between dissimilarities of population, territory, or social, economic, cultural or political development, which reflect the characteristic features and peculiarities of these states, and we should increasingly make progress in this idea of international economic interdependence we have maintained this line of approach and we will continue to maintain it in the economic and social council and in all the subsidiary bodies which are entrusted with the heavy responsibility of fostering the progress of peoples through modern methods  many barriers of prejudices and archaic conventional attitudes will still have to be overthrown  in this task which confronts the states members of the organization, the dominican republic has steadily opted in favor of the adoption of new formula and rules which can lead us to solutions that will eradicate the pressures and international tensions that allow us no respite in recent years the dominican republic has advocated a formula to put an end to the conflict in the middle east in accordance with methods for the solution of situations of this kind  we are concerned about the state of stagnation in which this effort for peace has been bogged down; yet the effectiveness of this effort is the responsibility not only of all free peoples of the world but also of the organization itself the renewal of the mandate entrusted by the secretarygeneral to his special representative, ambassador jarring, has not only helped to reaffirm our faith in the instruments available to us to restore peace where it has been breached, but it has also served to lessen considerable international tensions considerably and it has strengthened the hope that, finally, it will be possible to come to terms acceptable to the parties involved we understand that the road ahead will be subject to certain alternate choices which are characteristic of international life, but we see looming up the end of the task that we have undertaken to reach the peace agreement that we all long for the situation that has affected vietnam for a number of years has always been a source of concern to my country, which has cooperated as fully as possible and which in every instance has offered proper support in the difficult task of preserving the peace this is the policy that a small country such as ours would never wish to depart from at any time  we are proud of being a founding member of this community of nations, which is the greatest that has ever existed since the origin of mankind we must feel gratified when we see that the united states of america has been withdrawing sizable contingents of troops from the center of military operations in that area and that the central government has shown that it will continue to withdraw these troops in accordance with the statements made by president nixon  it is highly significant that this fact should have occurred precisely when we were entering upon the twentyfifth regular session of the general assembly of the world organization, with new prospects opening up for the future of the states members of this organization we sincerely believe that we are on the verge of witnessing the departure from vietnamese territory of the last united states troops in accordance with the timetable worked out  it is very comforting to see that after the stagnation in the efforts to reduce nuclear weapons that were being accumulated at a terrifying dramatic pace, we can now say that progress has been made, which my delegation cannot overlook in all sincerity i believe that this is perhaps the most important item for those of us who are participating in this general assembly, and we would hope that the assembly will emerge from this session fortified with all its constructive potential  this would serve as a kind of lever of archimedes, which is the will of all peoples on this commemorative anniversary to mark the dawn of a new era in the world in which good understanding will prevail designed to achieve the goal we have set ourselves in the face of the dilemma with which the unbridled arms race confronts us a race into which we have been impelled by lack of confidence and by our blind attitude towards the danger that hangs over us in behalf of the government i represent, may i be permitted to pay a tribute of gratitude for this important development which has allayed the unrest and tensions to which we have been subjected for so many years we should also take into account the efforts made to come to an agreement on a treaty to prohibit the emplacement of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction on the seabed, the ocean floor and in the subsoil thereof, which in truth would constitute an effective step towards the conclusion of the treaty on general and complete disarmament which is so anxiously awaited in addition, for the same reasons, we would praise the action that has been undertaken to halt the development of chemical and bacteriological means of warfare and also arduous efforts under way to ensure that such weapons are prohibited from the arsenals of nations it is disturbing to note that the production of such means of destruction should have marked a considerable step backwards in international thinking on war despite the geneva protocol of which prohibits the use of this type of weapon  and that reversion to a position we had left behind long age under the influence of the lofty principles of humanity and should have created a situation in which the general assembly finds it necessary to call upon states to fulfil the principles of that important protocol accordingly, it would be well for us to come to an agreement which not only guarantees observance of the prohibition in platonic terms but also provides for the verification of compliance with this protocol  without the latter measure, which has already received the support of some members of the organization, we shall not be able to achieve chemical and bacteriological disarmament and thus safeguard mankind from weapons that are as inhuman as nuclear weapons themselves every effort that is made to arrive at reasonable disarmament and to avoid the overflow of these vast arsenals, which are a source of concern to us, will command the vigorous support of the dominican republic  we therefore viewed certain relaxations of tension which have been brought about in geneva in the field of disarmament as a promising omen that will increase the confidence of peaceloving peoples since the united nations has been able to survive all the tests to which it has been subjected so far, this argument alone would suffice to justify the efforts we should exert to ensure that it continues to achieve the objectives for which it was created, at a decisive moment when the scourge of war had imperiled all of modern civilization true, there has been much criticism of the united nations  we must confess that much of this criticism is justified, but we cannot deny that most of it is exaggerated or not really justified if we examine the criticism objectively no matter how strict we may be, we cannot deny its positive achievements which have proved to be milestones in history  this criterion allows us to take into consideration the fact that we have tried to create a perfect organization in a world in which mankind handiwork always suffers from imperfections however that may be, under the sheltering umbrella of the principles of the charter we have been able to demonstrate how useful dialog is at the high level of this organization  we thus arrive at the affirmation that it is difficult to negotiate when we hear the cannons roar it is understandable that despite the complexities of international life some would like to see the united nations take more dynamic action, and more willingness to comply with its resolutions  i venture to surmise that this is due largely to the sensibilities involved and the magnitude of the interests often in conflict  but that does not mean that we should not foster the idea of a fresh endeavor and for this it will probably be necessary to bring the charter up to date so that it will reflect the changes that have occurred and will continue to occur in our time while it is obvious that the principles of the united nations are influential even as they are now structured, we would hope that its legal and moral authority will be exercised with greater efficiency when they have been revised and have had time to acquire their full strength and vigor i should now like to make a comment concerning the record of the tremendous accomplishments of the united nations during the years of its existence and say that my delegation would venture to suggest that if the organization has not been very effective, as its critics allege, that is in large measure the fault of ourselves, the member states, because in fact we have not given the organization all the support and effective collaboration needed to uphold those principles and resolutions which have not been applied or have been applied imperfectly or very tardily during the twentyfourth session of the general assembly my government had the opportunity to state its interest in the idea that the assembly should provide favorable conditions for a firm step towards agreement on a system for international security \\u2003 at that time my delegation said, and i reaffirm it now, that the mobilization of wills towards an achievement of this kind for the world would be the best contribution we could make to the celebrations marking the twentyfifth anniversary of the united nations  it would also be the greatest tribute we could pay on this happy occasion to all who have been the victims of war    it is my privilege to conveythe warmest congratulations of the government r d delegation of the dominican republic, and my own personal congratulations, to mr  ismat t  kittani on his fitting election to the presidency of the thirtysixth session of the general assembly, which election augers well for our discussions i should like at the same time to express my admiration for mr  rudiger von wechmar outstanding, correct and vigorous direction of the session just ended the delegation of the dominican republic, on behalf of its government and people, extends its condolences to the family of president anwar el sadat and to the people and government of the republic of egypt on the tragic death of their head of state, who was one of the pillars upholding peace in the middle east and in the world today  his death moves us to the most profound thoughts, both in the very heart of the united nations and in the states that constitute the international community a/pv it is a great pleasure to extend a very cordial and friendly welcome to the new member states that have joined the organization  we are sure that vanuatu and belize will, by their spirit of collaboration and their identification with the principles of the charter of the united nations, contribute to the achievement of the objectives that fortunately led to its birth in san francisco in  permitting the world to enter a new era of peace after the devastation of the last world war allow me, as secretary of state for external relations of the dominican republic, to endorse before the general assembly these words which justify the existence of the united nations: peace is the foundation of international order and the most effective instrument of human progress the situations of conflict we are facing in this period of history illustrate, from every point of view, the sentence i have just quoted  we are living in the nuclear age; we are living through a crisis of law and the proliferation of the most destructive weapons ever conceived  only with a spirit of good will, cooperation and solidarity will the states members of the organization succeed in finding the formulas that are urgently needed for achieving peace the task is undoubtedly a difficult and why not say it  ominous one, as the panorama of international politics becomes increasingly complex  nevertheless, we believe that peace is not impossible when human beings are confronted with a dilemma that has become a challenge to their very survival the dominican republic, a small country, has struggled vigorously for the rule of freedom and peace in the world, and it is striving increasingly to conduct its international relations in accordance with the standards established in the founding instrument of the world organization and in the light of the principles of international law many years passed before the reality of what the caribbean represents for this part of the world was taken into account and assessed in the context of the hemisphere  colonial history reveals that the surrounding ocean was a closed and mysterious place that served as a setting for pirates, buccaneers and freebooters  the history of the island of tortuga is a murky drama, as described by one of the most respected historians and jurists of the dominican republic  this island, located in the path of the hurricanes, is still a reminder of an age of intrigue and death no analysis is needed to state that the insularity of the caribbean area is a fragmented one  it produces characteristic sociological phenomena that have not been advantageous to our harmonious and lasting union  the dominican republic enjoys the privilege of being probably the first country to point out that, because of its very nature and geographical situation, insularity should lead to thinking on a regional scale because of mutual interests and the new perspectives now opening up in the world thus, this idea, which had become rooted in the nation political thinking, began to take concrete shape during the official visit made to my country by the minister for external relations of costa rica in  a novel and realistic conception of the greater caribbean area came into being, based on linking all the independent countries whose territories are washed by those waters the work being done to make the caribbean basin initiative an immediate reality is most encouraging  this initiative originated with the group sponsored by the united states, and its participants now include the united states, canada, mexico and venezuela  thus the countries of the region now facing the direct impact of the crisis affecting the international economy could rely on financial resources to meet the challenge of their development the caribbean basin initiative began to take practical shape after the nassau meeting of the foreign ministers of those four nations in july of this year  the countries of the area are actively working to make its program of action an immediate reality, for the dismal future looming ahead of us does not permit delay we are aware that private investment will play a large role in this program  it must be recognized, however, that several factors will prevent these investments from producing good results in the short term  the hesitancy to commit capital, the lack of energy sources and, in some cases, of the indispensable infrastructure and the high interest rates prevailing in financial markets can constitute discouraging factors for potential private investors  we therefore feel that, in view of the pressing economic situation facing our countries, the program must give priority to official assistance* both financial and through the adoption of measures to eliminate the barriers that affect our countries' exports ' for the dominican republic, whose main export product is sugar, it is a matter for grave concern that various countries that import this staple food are taking measures that have very negative repercussions on selling prices  reconsideration of those measures, which have such a serious effect not only on the dominican republic but on other countries as well, would be an effective and helpful measure of cooperation to be taken by the countries that have adopted them i would like to say how pleased the government of the dominican republic was to allow the city of santo domingo to host the important meetings on the caribbean basin initiative  these meetings, which are being held this very week, will assemble representatives from the caribbean countries, central america and the group sponsored by the united states we should like to make special mention in this world forum of the valuable economic cooperation we are receiving from the countries of the region in the context of the energy cooperation program for central american and caribbean countries, concluded at san jose on august by the presidents of mexico and venezuela, the main suppliers of the oil we consume, under which mexico and venezuela are financing part of our oil bill  these funds will be used for development projects we have become convinced that human rights and terrorism are separate subjects and that each must be considered individually  we cannot avoid recognizing the fact that under many circumstances there is an obvious connection between them in the battle against violation of human rights, the authorities whose task it is to maintain public order have often exceeded the limits established by law  i am referring to a situation in which, in the context of its activity to contain the spreading tide of terrorism, legitimate authority exceeds its jurisdiction and expands its activity to a point where it can be termed a violation of the law  this gives rise to the idea that the concept of state terrorism must be added to that of terrorism pure and simple  abuse of power, which is also a criminal offense, cannot be allowed to reinforce legitimate prosecution  to exceed those limits constitutes a violation of human rights by the authority acting to prevent this type of violation in this context, we should like to mention the proposal made by the federal republic of germany to contribute to a decision aimed at embodying respect for human rights in more concrete form  it is paradoxical that on the one hand physical integrity is considered an inalienable right within the general structure of human rights while on the other hand there is no provision barring the death penalty in this period typified by a demand for human rights there is one unacceptable note of discord: namely, the fact that in some countries a punishment reminiscent of the lex talionis is still in effect  the right to punish implies the obligation to regenerate and rehabilitate the individual who committed the offense  changes in criminological thinking are considerable, and the abandonment of outmoded and barbaric ideas is being advocated  the continued entrusting to the state of the destruction of human beings by human beings, therefore, seems unjustifiable at the thirtyfifth session my delegation spoke about this situation [h meeting, paras  , which in our opinion is an anomaly  at that time we noted that the american convention on human rights' prohibits capital punishment on the one hand while on the other hand tolerating it in those states where it existed prior to the signing of the convention  the substantive law of the dominican republic prohibits capital punishment, and when we signed the convention we expressed the hope that in the future this anomaly would be eliminated from that interamerican instrument governing human rights since the first outbreaks of terrorism in the second half of this century the dominican republic has supported the principle that terrorism is a violation of common law and accordingly that classifying it as such may be the key to limiting the incidence of international crime  classification of it as a political crime hinders punishment under the legal system for many acts which then cease to be the subject of the public rejection that justifies the existence of public order  it also elevates the most loathsome transgressions to the status of heroic deeds in those cases classification as political crimes encourages protection through asylum and thwarts extradition  in this situation, we recommend that the ad hoc committee on international terrorism review these arguments thoroughly and include in its study a specific analysis to determine the applicability of triple classification of political crimes according to their nature, their motives and the association of the political crime with a common law crime  this has enjoyed a certain acceptance among those who propound the tripartite idea of the political crime and suggests that classifying terrorism as a crime against the law of nations, with all its consequences, might ultimately prove to be the radical formula that could at last reduce the uncontrolled spread of terrorism we believe that the states members of the united nations are persuaded that terrorism could lead to a state of anarchy, since it shows every sign of increasing rather than diminishing  the victims of this grave social and political outrage are generally innocent persons while the perpetrators suffer no risks, as in the case of the taking of hostages, the seizing of aircraft with their passengers and many other forms of terrorism, which must be condemned by joint action among the acts of terrorism which have shocked the world this year and which point to a kind of return to barbarism are the assassination attempts made on president ronald reagan and on the holy father, pope john paul n  they occurred before the echoes or the condemnation by all civilized nations of the taking of postages at the american embassy at teheran and at the dominican republic embassy at bogota had died down  it could be said that the sacrilegious hand of evil was raised as proof of the unwillingness to search for legal methods and effective formulas to halt the wave of international terrorism let us think also of the dramatic death of president anwar el sadat  terrorism is indeed the most odious form of crime my delegation wishes to mention at this point the appeal now being made by the organization for the fostering of goodneighborly relations in the interest of maintaining international peace and security  it is certainly the aim of this proposal to lead to better understanding and harmony among nations, with the consequent reduction of international tensions, and to provide support in preventing disputes and conflicts within the context of this idea of goodneighborliness, the dominican delegation has submitted a plan [ibid , paras   based on the relations between the governments of the dominican republic and haiti, which share sovereignty over the second largest island in the antilles archipelago  the results flow not only from that premise but also from one that we consider more specific, that of permanent good will between peoples and governments  that statement transcends the principle of the interamerican legal system  to make it doctrinally more attractive and more viable, the idea of a method of action has been embodied in the promising and dynamic phrase a better will, which implies the idea of continual and progressive transformations toward the goal of brotherhood among states with this conviction, we support the proposal on the agenda which gives us the opportunity to make an evaluation that we feel is more ambitious and at the same time more direct and practical: the extension of a, kind of good will doctrine to all states alike  it would be a collective appeal, born of the organization, and its aim in these times of conflict that disturbs the peace of the world would be the defeat or at least the diminishing of the warlike spirit that blocks the peaceful solution of the international conflicts threatening mankind the foregoing remarks make this an appropriate time to refer to the countries that share the korean peninsula the dominican government has often advocated dialog as the master key that opens the door to good understanding and helps in finding peaceful formulas for settling the conflicts that affect various areas of the earth  accordingly we favor the resumption of discussions between south korea and north korea so that the koreans themselves may find favorable conditions that can lead to the most suitable independent and peaceful solutions, the reestablishment of mutual trust and the achievement of a lasting peace between the two communities in accordance with the principles of the charter, in particular the principle concerning the free selfdetermination of peoples on a footing of equality and mutual respect 'one supremely important event that serves as yet another example of the dangers lying in wait for the international legal community and thus for the maintenance of peace is the unjustified invasion of afghanistan, which is contrary to the basic principles of the charter we cannot ignore the fact that it is the responsibility and within the jurisdiction of the organization to restore the rights trampled underfoot by some states to the detriment of others, when generally speaking the actions are not in response to an act of aggression  even in such an exceptional case such actions are lawful only when the security council has before it an armed conflict, which is not the case with the invading country in those circumstances, in order to eliminate the precedent tendentiously created and the consequences of a fait accompli, the least we can hope is that the peace loving countries will support the resolution approved by the council of the european community calling for an international conference to find a satisfactory solution that will permit afghanistan to recover its independence and return to its previous status as a nonaligned country 2within those peaceful outlines proposed by the european council to the soviet union to permit the convening of the conference as quickly as possible, it is absolutely necessary that a consensus in favor of such an initiative be reached at this session  its implementation would diminish the existing tension that is disturbing the peace we have devoted particular attention to agenda item  on the review of the implementation of the declaration on the strengthening of international security for we consider the maintenance of the principle of nonintervention to be vital to the maintenance of peace we believe that observers of the international political scene cannot fail to be aware of the violations and the progressive weakening in recent years of the principle of nonintervention, which is the backbone of the maintenance of peace under the aegis of the united nations  that has been happening despite the general assembly reaffirmation last year [resolution , on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the declaration on the strengthening of international security, of the universal and unconditional validity of the basic principles of the charter, which apply equally to all countries without distinctions of any kind at that time, states were urged to comply strictly with their obligations under the charter, and it was urged that the provisions of the declaration be applied as a means of making peaceful coexistence possible we cannot fail to note the urgent need to practice and support noninterference in the internal affairs of states and to have recourse to peaceful methods for the solution of disputes  that proposal for strengthening peace and security is one for which we should all fight, in circumstances in which it would open wider the doors to international cooperation and render understanding among nations more effective conflicts undeniably persist in areas of africa  the situation in angola and the matter of namibia are cases in point  another worrisome problem is that notwithstanding the provisions forbidding the practice of apartheid, it continues to be a cause of friction and could lead to an explosion of violence, which is the principal enemy of peace we deplore the fact that in certain areas of conflict the atmosphere is not conducive to the discovery of correct formulas for peaceful solution through discussion  we can rejoice, however, in the fact that egypt and israel have been holding meetings concerning the withdrawal of israeli forces from the sinai peninsula  that will be a very promising beginning for resolute steps forward in accordance with the camp david accords  it proves that the climate is becoming more conducive to having peace gradually lead to a new era for the middle east, an area that for more than years has been overwhelmed by unpredictable negative risks at its thirtyfifth session the general assembly considered a proposal by the federal republic of germany for the creation of an appropriate mechanism for finding ways to control the alarming flood of refugees, which, in the words of the proposing nation, has become a growing threat to goodneighborly relations among states  consequently, it is a difficult problem, particularly for countries that have a common border the dominican delegation fully shares those concerns and would support the establishment of an ad hoc committee to assume the responsibilities deriving from the program for international cooperation to avert new flows of refugees \\\\the conflict between iran and iraq continues without the parties having found suitable formulas to end it by means of a system for peacefully resolving disputes and conflicts  we feel that mediation by the states members of this organization is in order, so that the parties involved may arrive at an honorable solution to end the military confrontation that has been devastating the peoples of both nations and which could degenerate into a major disruption in the area respecting the principles of nonintervention and selfdetermination of peoples, the dominican government shares the concern of the countries that support peace and human solidarity regarding the present situation in the sister republic of el salvador  we express our most fervent hope that the matter will be resolved quickly and in accordance with the sovereign will of the people of el salvador a review of the figures, in the light of what has been called the population explosion, causes concern when estimates and evaluations point to the existence on our planet of billion human beings by the year  that trend is occurring despite indications of concern by many countries regarding the prospects of excessive population growth, a problem that urgently calls for particular attention to family planning as regards the dominican republic, the organization is aware that the official plans cautiously being put into practice in our country are proving very satisfactory  we could say that in the dominican republic we are shaping a national awareness propitious to the practice of family planning and responsible parenthood and antithetical to the practice of abortion the dominican republic is honored to have been selected as the site of the international research and training institute for the advancement of women  i am pleased to inform the assembly that the future headquarters of that institute are now in the final stages of constriction and will be inaugurated in the near future  we encourage all states members of the organization to contribute to the trust fund for the institute the problem of food supply is developing at the same pace as that of population growth  for that reason, the entire world should recognize the importance of the third united nations conference on the law of the sea  it is therefore regrettable that after almost years of devotion to the work of establishing scientific principles to govern that inexhaustible source of wealth, it has not yet been possible to complete the final instrument that would be a source of salvation for the human race, threatened as it is with shortage in the near future of the resources that are indispensable for its survival and progress  therefore, regardless of the reasons for the failure to complete the final debates and to move next year to the signature of the longed for convention on the law of the sea,, it would seem desirable to sign the proposed convention at caracas next year, as soon as possible after next year sessions in new york population growth in the world undeniably constitutes a problem that makes imperative the vigorous and decisive mobilization of all production resources  based on those convictions, the government of the dominican republic has been encouraging agrarian reform and is devoting particular attention to agroindustry many years ago a famous dominican writer and politician, ulises francisco espaillat, father of independence and president of my country, had the foresight to point out the importance of agriculture for our nation  he declared with inspiring authority that work must be glorified and that of all industries agriculture was the easiest, the most useful, the most generous and the most fruitful  this exemplary dominican added with patriotic ardor that it was the most noble industry, the industry that most effectively provided that independence of position most suitable for citizens who wish to remain free and independent the economy of the dominican republic has not escaped the widespread effects of convulsions in other economies, which result from the irrepressible forces of this historic period of emerging decisions, a period that is irresistibly striving towards a new economic order as we approach the year  nevertheless, the efforts made by our government during the last three years though troubled in part, especially by the forces of nature thanks to the pragmatic actions of antonio guzman, head of the dominican state, show a normal situation in the national economy, in the context of free enterprise and the full force and effect of public freedoms a cautious monetary and fiscal policy is being carried out  the fiscal policy provides for adjustment of public expenditures to the income from taxes; under the monetary policy, unduly rapid expansion of the money supply has been brought under control and the money has been channeled chiefly towards the productive sectors, particularly agriculture and industry an aggressive policy to promote nontraditional exports is being followed and is producing positive results;  it should be mentioned that under a recent law, generous incentives are given to the exporters of nontraditional products  one such incentive permits them to retain a portion of the foreign currencies earned by these exports, paying to the central bank of the dominican republic only an officially predetermined percentage today more than ever we must keep in mind the mandate of the creator of the universe that man must earn his daily bread by the sweat of his brow  thus, the divine work extends to the urgent mandate to win peace with the energy of our mortal, human blood  we venture to say that this is the primary challenge of our age, starting with our presence here at this time to fulfill a transcendent promise  the general assembly must go in search of solutions required by conflicts that we cannot allow to continue and become chronic  a final explosion could jeopardize the very existence of the organization, which is the only constructive institution created by the last world war  a repetition of that conflict must be prevented at all costs to conclude these reflections, we should like to call to mind the third encyclical of his holiness pope john paul ii, entitled laborem exercens, dedicated to those who earn their bread by the sweat of their brow, to workers of all kinds, manual, intellectual, industrial or agricultural, who labor in the midst of the most intense, sudden and ominous tensions in the midst of their debates, delegations at this thirtysixth session of the general assembly should meditate on the exhortation contained in the vary word work which has come down through the ages as a perpetual and resolute echo of the voice of god  it is a great honour for me speak from this rostrum of the world organization in order to make known my government views and feelings on the many important problems that are to be discussed at the seventeenth session of the general assembly i should like to extend my sincere congratulations to mr  muhammad zafrulla khan for his welldeserved election to preside over our deliberations  his great learning, his long experience in the service of the loftiest of international causes, his wisdom and judgement are, as we have seen here, the attributes that go to make a good president on behalf of the people and government of the dominican republic, i extend a hearty welcome to the new states which are joining this family of nations  our welcome and our best wishes go to rwanda, burundi, jamaica, and trinidad and tobago, as also to algeria, which has just been admitted to the united nations at home, the dominican republic has begun to make amends for the cruelties, tortures, persecutions, assassinations, deprivations and abuses inflicted on the dominican; nation by the tyrant trujillo, who was fortunately brought to justice on may  by a group of national heroes whose two sole surviving members, mr  antonio imbert barrera and mr  luis amiama, are serving on the council of state the present government has undertaken to attend to the immediate needs created by the chaotic situation and, with the resolute cooperation of the people and the help of the alliance for progress programme, it has provided new opportunities for employment in emergency public works projects  the wealth amassed under the dictatorship has been invested in a development corporation which is using, for the benefit of the dominican people and on behalf of that people, the riches of which they had previously been divested  a housing programme has been initiated; an agrarian reform is being carried out, with the result that hundreds of families have been settled, on land previously occupied by the relations and henchmen of the tyrant  the international credit of the republic has been restored and the banking system has undergone a scientific reconstruction which will enable the nation wealth to be better utilized the council of state also has the honour, as care taker government, of establishing a democratic system, based on the will of the people, which will be expressed in the course of free elections to be held on december, in which the attributes of the individual citizen — those which lend dignity to man — will finally acquire their full moaning  this task will be carried out with the valuable assistance of the technical electoral commission which the dominican government asked the organization of american states to provide at the international level, the dominican republic is preparing to fulfil all its obligations and to cooperate to the best of its ability in ensuring that the international community and the juridical instruments at its disposal shall acquire the maximum efficacy with that end in view, my country will abide by all the decisions taken by the united nations, in keeping with the charter on which it is founded and in particular with the advisory opinion of the international court of justice whereby the expenses incurred in operations ordered by the assembly shall be borne, together with the regular expenses, by all members of the organization  the dominican republic regards compliance with these decisions as an unavoidable duty and an absolute necessity, not only because it is an obligation under the charter but because it implies support of one of the most important organs of the united nations — the organ whose basic function is to give meaning and scope to the standards of international law  to disregard the rulings of the international court of justice would be to undermine the new international order which the united nations is seeking to establish  it would, in fact, be a backward step that would deal a severe blow to law and order and would establish force as the determining factor in relations between states with regard to disarmament and all that this problem entails, the dominican republic considers that the overarmed powers are called upon to end the state of mistrust and fear in which mankind is living, by deciding to put an end to the armaments race  the world demands this because disarmament is not a problem which affects the armed powers alone but is a general problem which concerns all of us, since modern wars are not mere episodes confined to tire belligerents, but tragedies which involve the whole of mankind one of the many problems which the dominican republic views with concern is the plight of the underdeveloped countries  until these nations enjoy the benefits of social justice and economic prosperity, they will always be a prey to anxiety and frustration —sentiments which sow the seeds of unrest and are the prelude to agitation and subversive ideas incompatible with the atmosphere of peace in which peoples wish to live  there can be no democracy or freedom in a world in which poverty and social injustice prevail the twin concepts of freedom and democracy will reach true fulfilment when the efforts that are now being devoted to the armaments race are used to eradicate the causes of poverty and injustice  the dominican republic accordingly commends and supports the measures that have been proposed in order to remedy this situation and especially the plan which is now in operation to promote social advancement and raise the level of living in accordance with a broader concept of freedom, as provided in the charter  it also fully endorses the remarks made in a recent report by u thant, the secretarygeneral: if this organization is to make the principles enshrined in the preamble of the charter a living reality, there must be no pause in the determined, sincere and continuing campaign: to reduce world tensions and hostility  the people of the world who continue to live in such a tense and surcharged atmosphere, replete with the ever present threat of total destruction, are entitled to look forward to the dawn of a' new era in which every man, woman and child in every country can be expected to live above want and in dignity, at peace with themselves and with the rest of mankind  [a//add l, page]in keeping with these ideas, the liquidation of colonialism which must proceed at a faster rate should not be restricted merely to the granting of independence to peoples who have been subjugated but must take on a broader dimension  the political solution, in the form of liberation from all foreign domination, is of paramount importance but is not enough  it alone will not appease the urge for emancipation  economic independence is just as important as political independence, for until it is fully achieved the bonds of colonialism will persist  as long as those peoples remain in the background, as mere suppliers of raw materials to the highly industrialized centres, they will not have achieved complete freedom nor will they have attained the complete happiness to which they have a right  it is therefore imperative that the plan to which i referred just now should be extended to include them, in a positive way, since they are the oneswho’ need it most at the present time fortunately, in the western hemisphere this serious problem is being solved by the determination of our peoples to put the programmes of the alliance for progress into effect without delay; those programmes are already sapping the foundations of a feudal era which is giving way to a revolutionary evolution, as it has been termed by the president of the dominican republic and of the council of state it is a pity that these programmes for social progress are being constantly held up by the lastditch efforts of reactionaries who are endeavouring to retain their privileges and by the communists, who see in it the defeat of their tactics, which are based primarily on demagogy  obstacles of the kind that are now being encountered by the alliance for progress were similarly experienced in europe at the time of the marshall plan the impartial study of the ideological trends which divide the world, is a privilege of the free man  those of us who bear the grave and solemn responsibility of speaking from this rostrum have an inescapable obligation to analyse the merits and demerits of the two contending positions  so long as the spectre of man destruction haunts a century that has suffered the tragedy of two world wars and a series of other wars, confined to specific geographical areas, which have decimated the youth of five continents, the weight and significance of each word, of each phrase and of each idea spoken from this forum must of necessity be directed towards the promotion of a worldwide desire for peace and justice for all  peace and justice cannot be achieved by vitriolic attacks or by slander and false accusations, by the use of demagogy or by hasty attempts to impose a particular system on a people without allowing it to listen to the debates — not the fallacies and pretexts but the substance of the ideas that seek to influence and guide the world  the united nations cannot and must not deceive the nations of which it is composed, for if this were to happen, civilization would find itself in a vacuum the cuban situation and its implications for the regional system has been referred to in this assembly and we must therefore discuss it  the cuban government has cut itself off from the rest of the hemisphere by failing to meet the conditions which the charter of the organization of american states prescribes for its members  we wonder what caused the withdrawal of the cuban government from the continental system  in order to answer that question we must make a brief excursion into history from the very beginning of the independence movement in america, the struggle, acquired a mystique which lent it greater impetus and led it from victory to victory, on to its final triumph  basically, the struggle was not for the solo purpose of gaining freedom but was also waged with the aim of improving the system of government prevailing at that time, which was absolute monarchy in which the monarch was sovereign ruler and proclaimed his powers to be of divine origin after the united states achieved independence, the concept — not new in theory but new in practice —  that the people alone are sovereign began to gain ground  this concept calls to mind benjamin franklin, of whom it was  said: he snatched the lightening from the skies and the sceptre from the tyrants  the sceptre of tyrants was the symbol of sovereignty  seized from its holder, it passed to a new sovereign — the people  since then a new concept has grown up in america, that of selfdetermination  each people decided its future as a free nation by force of arms, whereby it severed its ties with the mother country  but within the new boundaries of the state, the nation destinies had to be decided by the people, established as the new sovereign, which, unlike the earlier physical entity of the monarch or aspirant to the monarchy, was a complex, manysided being, made up of thousands of individuals whose opinions, as yet unknown, had to be expressed peacefully, in order to be able to respond to the truth, to the new principle that only the people are sovereign  nil novi sub sole — nothing is new under the sun  an old principle was thus given a new application to meet the needs of the times, which were representative democracy and electoral processes and procedures  having grown wary as the result of previous experiences, the people began from the very outset to resist such expedients as acclamations at public meetings and armed coercion, and to understand that in order to ensure that the elections resulted in genuine representation of the new sovereign, it was essential to safeguard the process by guarantees of all the civil liberties which were embodied in the constitutions and their amendments latin america has been engaged for more than a century — for reasons which i shall not go into here, owing to the shortage of time — in a continual struggle against the violation of these principles which were so dear to the founders of the various nations of the continent  each dictatorship set out with the sincere or feigned intention of remedying the deficiencies of the preceding regime  it is equally true, however, that each dictatorship has always tried to justify itself by a show of respect — naturally spurious — for representative democracy, no matter what enormities it committed against the rights of the people foremost among the rights of the people which were violated or suppressed was the right to life, which was abruptly ended  by thei firing squad of the political opponent or by the assassin dagger or threatened by the dungeon  then there was the deprivation of all liberties and of the right to a better economic existence based on social justice and without the sway of the traditional oligarchies, feudal practices and the near enslavement of the less privileged classes when the interamerican system was established, this centuryold tradition was incorporated into it as a basic principle; thus, the exercise of representative democracy is an essential requirement for membership of the group  renunciation of this principle implies automatic exclusion from the system and it was this principle that was rejected by the cuban government when it announced its adherence to marxismleninism it should be made clear that the system has not set itself up as a stern accusor to browbeat governments which, owing to temporary circumstances or to more or less prolonged lapses, hive departed from the basic tenets of the system  this is a mistake that democratic governments must strive to correct it can readily be seen that the juridical and political standards of the interamerican system entails the following progressive series of conditions: (a) respect for human rights; (b) exercise of the inherent freedoms of the citizen, without which no opinion can be expressed; (c) free elections, with majority and minority representation of the people, as appropriate; (d) freedom not only to constitute a government by means of elections but also to replace it by the same means  these are the conditions for achieving representative democracy and through it — and only through it — selfdetermination  parallel with these concepts, there has also developed, as an intrinsic part of the system, the principle of nonintervention, which has been of inestimable value in promoting interamerican relations and has been the staunch defence of the weaker nations against the stronger  at times, this very principle has served certain regimes as a pretext for retaining power in outright violation of democratic precepts; at other times it has served as a pretext for evading action that should have been taken we are sure, however, that though the principle of nonintervention has not yet taken final shape it will eventually be defined in harmony with the new concept of the interdependence of states engaged in a common undertaking against this background the eighth meeting of consultation of ministers of foreign affairs, at punta del este adopted resolution vi, which reads as follows: whereas: the interamerican system is based on consistent adherence by its constituent states to certain objectives and principles of solidarity, set forth in the instruments that govern it; among these objectives and principles are those of respect for the freedom of man and preservation of his rights, the full exercise of representative democracy, nonintervention of one state in the internal or external affairs of another, and rejection of alliances and agreements that may lead to intervention in america by extracontinental powers; the seventh meeting of consultation of ministers of foreign affairs, held in san josé, costa rica, condemned the intervention or the threat of intervention of extracontinental communist powers in the hemisphere and reiterated the obligation of the american states to observe faithfully the principles of the regional organization; the present government of cuba has identified itself with the principles of marxistleninist ideology, has established apolitical, economic, and social system based on that doctrine, and accepts military assistance from extracontinental communist powers, including even the threat of military intervention in america on the part of the soviet union; the report of the interamerican peace committee to the eighth meeting of consultation of ministers of foreign affairs establishes that: ‘the present connexions of the government of cuba with the sinosoviet bloc of countries are evidently incompatible with the principles and standards that govern the regional system, and particularly with the collective security established by the charter of the organization of american states and the interamerican treaty of reciprocal assistance’; the abovementioned report of the interamerican peace committee also states that: ‘it is evident that the ties of the cuban government with the sino soviet bloc will prevent the said government from fulfilling the obligations stipulated in the charter of the organization and the treaty of reciprocal assistance’; such a situation in an american state violates, the obligations inherent in membership in the regional system and is incompatible with that system; the attitude adopted by the present government of cuba and its acceptance of military assistance offered by extracontinental communist powers breaks down the effective defence of the interamerican system; and no member state of the interamerican system can claim the rights; and privileges pertaining thereto if it denies or fails to recognize the corresponding obligation, declares:  that, as a consequence of repeated acts, the present government of cuba has voluntarily placed itself outside the interamerican system   that this situation demands unceasing vigilance on the part of the member states of the organization of american states, which shall report to the council any fact or situation that could endanger the peace and security of the hemisphere   that the american states have a collective interest in strengthening the interamerican system and reuniting it on the basis of respect for human rights and the principles and objectives relative to the exercise of democracy set forth in the charter of the organization; and, therefore resolves:  that adherence by any member of the organization of american states to marxismleninism is incompatible with the interamerican system and the alignment of such a government with the communist bloc breaks the unity and solidarity of the hemisphere   that the council of the organization of, american states and the other organs and organizations of the interamerican system adopt without delay measures necessary to comply with this resolution the consequences of this resolution are revealed in the following communique, which has the distinction of having been approved unanimously by all the foreign ministers of america, or their representatives, at the recent informal meeting held at washington  the communique reads as follows: in their informal meeting held in washington, d c , on october and   the foreign ministers and special representatives of american republics discussed in a spirit of strong friendship and cooperation the serious problems that face the western hemisphere  although the informal character of the meeting precluded formal decisions or resolutions, which are in the competence, of the appropriate bodies of the oas, the meeting was marked by extraordinary solidarity on matters affecting the security and wellbeing of the hemispheric system  the ministers reviewed the resolutions adopted at the eighth meeting of consultation of ministers of foreign affairs, the progress made in response to them, and further steps which might be taken to give effect to those resolutions  during the meeting it was manifest that at the present juncture the most urgent of these problems, is the sinosoviet intervention in cuba as an attempt to convert the island into an armed base for communist penetration of the americas and subversion of the democratic institutions of the hemisphere  the meeting reiterated its adherence to the principles of selfdetermination, nonintervention and democracy as guiding standards of relations among the american nations  the meeting reflected the opinion that now more than ever it is necessary to strengthen the system of representative democracy and to redouble the efforts being made to bring harmonious progress the peoples, and the earliest and most effective improvement in their standard of living, within the framework of the alliance for progress, and with the most complete respect for human rights  special consideration shall be given to expanding markets and increasing prices of latin american primary products  the meeting reasserted the firm intention of the governments represented and of the peoples of the american republics to conduct themselves in accordance with the principles of the regional system, staunchly sustaining and consolidating the principles of the charter of the organization of american states, and affirmed the will to strengthen the security of the hemisphere against all aggression from within or outside the hemisphere and against 'all developments or situations capable of threatening the peace and security of the hemisphere through the application of the interamerican treaty of reciprocal assistance of rio de janeiro, it was the view of the ministers that the existing organizations and bodies of the interamerican system should intensify the carrying out of their respective duties with special and urgent attention to the situation created by the marxistleninist  regime in cuba and that they should stand in readiness to consider the matter promptly if the situation requires measures beyond those already authorized  in the ideological struggle against communism, destroyer of man liberties, the meeting expressed the desire that the resources and methods inherent in the democratic system should be mobilized to bring the peoples to realize fully the difference between totalitarianism and democracy  the meeting reaffirmed its repudiation of repressive measures which, under the pretext of isolating or combating communism, may facilitate the appearance or strengthening of doctrines and methods which attempt to repress ideas of social progress and to confuse truly progressive and democratic labour organizations and cultural and political movements with communist subversion  the meeting observed that the interamerican regional system has had since its beginnings characteristics of its own that are expressed in specific provisions agreed upon by a community of nations for its collective security and, therefore, that a  that the present government of cuba, which has officially identified itself as a marxistleninist government, is incompatible with the principles and objectives of the interamerican system   that this incompatibility excludes the present  government of cuba from participation in the inter american system  military intervention of communist powers in cuba cannot be justified as a situation analogous to the defensive measures adopted in other parts of the free world in order to face soviet imperialism  the meeting expressed the need for undertaking the actions called for by resolution viii of the eighth meeting of consultation of ministers of foreign affairs, especially paragraph  also including the use of their ships in the cuban trade, in the light of the new developments taking place in cuba  it also called upon all other independent countries to review their policies in this regard  the meeting agreed that it is necessary for the countries, in accordance with their laws and constitutional precepts, to intensify measures to prevent agents and groups of international communism from carrying on their activities of a subversive nature  the meeting recalled that the soviet union intervention in cuba threatens the unity of the americas and of its democratic institutions, and that this intervention has special characteristics which; pursuant to paragraph of resolution ii of the eighth meeting of consultation of ministers of foreign affairs, call for the adoption of special measures, both individual and collective  the meeting observed that it is desirable to intensify individual and collective surveillance of the delivery of arms and implements of war and all other items of strategic importance to the communist regime of cuba, in order to prevent the secret accumulation in the island of arms that can be used foil; offensive purposes against the hemisphere  the meeting concurred in the wish that studies be undertaken urgently, in accordance with resolution ii of the eighth meeting of consultation of ministers of foreign affairs, of the transfer of funds to the other american republics for subversive purposes, the flow of subversive propaganda and the utilization of cuba as a base for training in subversive techniques  the meeting voiced the traditional fraternal affection of all the american peoples for the people of cuba and their deep sympathy for the victims of the present regime, and expressed the hope that the cuban people may return as a full member of the democratic american family of nations, under a government compatible with the purposes and principles of the interamerican system with the deliberate intention of distorting the facts, an attempt has been made to represent the case of cuba as a conflict involving that country and the united states alone, to the total exclusion of the latin american republics  this concept, of course, does not correspond to the facts, as is amply demonstrated by the punta del este documents and those, of the meeting of foreign ministers at washington to which i have referred  from the very moment that the government of cuba turned its back on democracy and its contractual obligations under the interamerican system and began to violate — often very seriously — the spirit and letter of treaties and conventions of vital importance to the continent, an extremely serious crisis arose between the cuban government the cuban people and between the cuban government and the government and peoples of rest of america the communist propaganda line, which is designed to convey the impression that a conflict exists solely between cuba and the united states, is damaging to latin america because it seeks to make latin america, appear as if it were a group of republics which are not conscious of their own responsibilities and are incapable of discerning the imminent danger to which they are exposed  this danger is caused by the existence of a government which, on american territory, has turned the land of josé martí, the great apostle of freedom, into a sinosoviet centre for military and political operations and for the ideological subversion of the democratic institutions of all the american nations, of their christian ethics and of their peaceful coexistenceowing to its exceptional political, military and economic relations with russia and communist china, the communist government of cuba constitutes a threat — unparalleled in the history of the hemisphere — to the peace, security and sovereignty of the american states the problem is not a quarrel or conflict between washington and havana  in an interamerican context it is a conflict between cuba and the republics of our continent, just as within a world context it is part of the struggle between east and west, between democracy and nondemocracy convinced as we are of the greatness of the nations that are members of the united nations, we find ourselves asking the following question, which we have no hesitation in putting to this august assembly: are there any peoples whose views are not legitimately represented here of necessity, and in order to do justice the profundity of the idea behind this question, we must begin by saying that the government of the dominican republic was not born of popular elections but of popular acceptance, won by conduct based on undeniable freedoms, on clearcut guarantees for the honest citizen, on the equitable administration of justice and above all on the firm determination of the president of the republic and the members of the council of state to hold elections in full view of any international observers who may wish to witness them  for, not only is it not afraid, but it is anxious for the world to see the triumph of the will of a people which, for more than three decades, has been pining for its freedom behind the prison bars of trujillo unprecedented tyranny thus, on december, the dominican republic will select a government through the proper and free exercise of the right to vote  in the certainty that this will come to pass, i appear before you with the proud humility of one who knows that he is not one of the elect but simply a servant of western civilization with every right to ask: are there any peoples whose views are not legitimately represented here the people seek peace — but not the peace of the firing squad or of the prisons packed with political opponents whose only crime was to disagree with the regime in power  the people seek peace — but not peace born of the sufferings of exile or peace born of the daily flight of those who risk their lives to escape  the people seek peace — but not peace which does away with the freedom of the press, which stifles the thoughts of men after robbing them, of their right to speak and turns them into terrorized beings who tremble in the presence of the accuser, who may send them to the scaffold on a trumpedup charge  the people seek peace — but not peace which prevents the worker from exercising his right to strike or robs the universities of their independence or compels the peasant to carry a gun to defend ideas which he does not understand  the people seek peace — but not peace which robs families of their loving children in order to send them away for indoctrination, whence they return so devoid of all filial affection that they inform on their parents  the people seek peace — but not peace that prohibits the holding of meetings in the fear that genuine elections will show the world how unpopular the leaders of the day really are  the people seek peace — but no peace which exports subversion, unrest and conspiracy to neighbouring countries, which are thus condemned to live in a state of constant anxiety, defending their democratic institutions  the people seek peace, but it is a different kind of peace  it is the peace which helps to eradicate all those evils, to remove the threat of war, subversion, hatred, unrest and terrorism  the peace that promotes understanding, industry, culture and happiness lastly, it is the peace which allows people to worship their own god and gives us the freedom to beg ours, from this high rostrum, to guide the united nations in its search for a way to live together in dignity, in peace without fear and justice without humiliation  i should like first to express to mr  hollai on this occasion my sincere congratulations on his unanimous election to the distinguished office of the president of the thirty seventh session of the general assembly and also to extend our congratulations to the other members of the general committee  the presidency of the general assembly constitutes a singular honour to the member state that occupies it, as well as to its regional group  my delegation also congratulates mr  kittani, who presided over the thirtysixth session of the general assembly with great success  my delegation also wishes to express its gratitude to the secretarygeneral, mr  javier perez de cuellar, whose experience and hard work in the service of the united nations have already been clearly demonstrated, and represent for the countries of the american continent a source of legitimate pride and satisfaction  the report which he has submitted to the general assembly is brilliant, and is proof of this; of the many documents that the organization produces, only a very few are as important as this call to reflection  his words not only enumerate the great problems that oppress the world, but also propose solutions to these grave and multiple problems  with the sincerity and emotion essential to the task of considering the fate of peoples, the secretarygeneral has made recommendations that do not shrink from criticism of and alternatives for the action of bodies within the united nations itself, such as the security council  his considered and valuable presentation has won the support and general approval of world opinion, and my delegation supports it fully the dominican republic is conscious of the complex and serious problems affecting the international community that are being debated at this session, and of the fact that those problems require measures commensurate with their seriousness and urgency, we are confident that within the framework of the law and the principles of the charter will be possible to adopt the measures that can lead to a better and more just international order it is for me a source of great satisfaction to participate in the assembly as secretary of state for foreign affairs of the new constitutional government of my country, inaugurated on august of this year  the government headed by president salvador jorge blanco assumed office in the dominican republic through the free and sovereign will of our people, expressed in free elections this government is the result of the institutional strength of a country that has been fulfilling its democratic vocation through constant struggle and great sacrifice  during the last years we have not only removed the obstacles that checked our democratic development, but we have also overcome situations that affected our standing as a sovereign nation the dominican republic is now enjoying a period characterized by the consolidation of its political democracy and is facing the urgent task of promoting economic development and social justice  at this time, within our institutional framework and with full respect for human rights, ideological pluralism and absolute freedom, the government intends to make those changes and reforms that are necessary to strengthen our economic democracy, one of the most legitimate aspirations of developing countries we consider it appropriate to point out those accomplishments because we firmly believe that the continuous and strengthening exercise of democracy in a small country such as ours, belonging to the group of third world nations, is an example to be proud of and strengthens our national purpose to achieve our own destiny without interference the political stability of dominican republic has created conditions which enable us to increase our effective participation in international relations, and to that end we offer our full cooperation in the search for peaceful solutions, strictly adhering to the principles of international law and of the charter, at a time when great conflicts and tension are shaking the international community  this activity will be exercised within our sovereign rights, without prejudices, inflexible positions or hegemonic constraints the strengthening of the traditional bonds of friendship that join us to certain countries will not be an obstacle to the substantial broadening of our frontiers in the vast and complex field of international relations, in as far as this is required by our national interests  above any other consideration, the unchangeable norm of our conduct in the international community will be absolute respect for and adherence to the legal and moral principles sustained and supported by the nations which together with ours form the organization in his inaugural speech as constitutional president of the dominican republic, mr  salvador jorge blanco outlined the attitude of his government in international affairs in the following words: we declare ourselves men of america, an essential part of an international community full of heroic deeds, an integral part of the new world searching daily for a collective existence, of the union of wills and efforts dedicated to the defense of social justice, to the struggle against underdevelopment  in these difficult moments for the countries of the third world the solidarity of the people of america is necessary and urgent and requires mutual support to help them overcome their pressing problems of subsistence and their terrible economic and political problems  in these difficult times, america, our magna patria, as it was called by pedro hennquez urena, should be a spearhead to thwart the constant menaces of a world holocaust and should be a bulwark of equilibrium in the concert of nations of the world  within this new spirit, the dominican government has decided to exercise further its traditional vocation for peaceful action and to participate as an active element in the search for solutions to the conflicts presently afflicting our brother countries of central america, and we are also prepared to collaborate in alleviating the international tension that affects other nations in the caribbean basin this attitude on the part of the dominican government is reflected in the decision to offer our immediate support for the purposes expressed jointly by the presidents of mexico and venezuela in a letter they addressed to the president of the united states of america, to the council of government of nicaragua and to the president of honduras, expressing their concern over the tense situation existing between the latter two countries in this instance the dominican government did not confine itself to simple support but expressed its willingness to participate, in whatever useful way it could, without detriment to the principle of nonintervention, in any effort to normalize relations between those two brother countries this position on the part of my government had already been expressed in the joint declaration issued in santo domingo on august last by the heads of state of venezuela, costa rica, nicaragua, belize and the dominican republic, on the express initiative of my government, in which those distinguished statesmen ratified their support for the fundamental principles of international law, which include the sovereign equality of all countries, respect for their independence and the territorial integrity, respect for the principle of nonintervention, non recourse to threats or use of force to resolve international conflicts, ideological pluralism, the selfdetermination of nations and respect for and faithful compliance with international treaties the declaration emphasizes: within the framework of the different proposals for peace in the central american region and the mechanisms to implement them, rejection of violent solutions, negotiations and dialogue are necessary for the solution of this crisis, a solution which must be the exclusive product of a common will and effort, with a view to promoting democracy, economic development and social justice moreover, we also made a cordial appeal to those democratic countries interested in the establishment of peace to apply their best efforts to achieve that end  for my country that declaration forms part of a profound commitment  we must help to stop the present bloodshed and thus avert the possible danger of cruel and extended confrontations  for our brother nations of central america we desire the full exercise of human rights  we consider it just and urgent that these countries be able to choose freely their own destiny and to devote their energies to full economic and social development we must emphasize that there is perhaps no other region as cohesive in its geography, its history, its ethnology, its economy and its culture as the caribbean  this region is characterized by the coexistence of traditional and emerging states  however, due to causes alien to the interests of its peoples, interchanges among the countries of the region have not been achieved to the extent that we would desire and welcome  the dominican republic has special characteristics which make it an ideal bridge for the realization of such exchanges among caribbean countries, especially at a time when we are strengthening our relations with the region new states for the dominican republic it is not utopian to believe and to say that the central american and caribbean region must become a zone of peace, of balance, stability, pluralism and the total rejection of military solutions this year there occurred in the south atlantic a deplorable event that disturbed the region but brought about solidarity in support of the just territorial claims of a brother nation an invariable aspect of the foreign policy of the dominican republic is our opposition to all forms and vestiges of colonialism in any part of the world  this has been a firm and consistent position expressed on innumerable occasions and in different international forums  within the organization, from the very outset, the dominican delegation has constantly supported all anticolonial recommendations and measures and has with clear determination contributed to the worthy process of decolonization that has been realized by the united nations throughout its history the dominican republic has been a peaceloving country  this position is unchangeable and is universally recognized  we believe that peace is the common goal of all mankind, the highest of social values, the indispensable norm for a harmonious and civilized life within each country and internationally we therefore address a cordial appeal to the republic of argentina and the united kingdom to resume within the framework of the united nations the necessary negotiations that will through dialogue and understanding permit a dignified, honourable and permanent solution to the conflict through the peaceful mechanism available to sovereign states under the charter of the united nations and international law we consider it appropriate to point out that this deplorable experience has deeply affected public faith in the effectiveness of the interamerican treaty of reciprocal assistance, signed at rio de janeiro in  as a proper instrument for the preservation of peace in our hemisphere and has once again demonstrated the urgent need to enrich and strengthen the system of collective security in that part of the world with the same firm will and resolve manifest in bogota when the organization of american states was founded there the dominican republic expresses its deep concern at the grave economic crisis affecting the international community, which is characterized by a reduced rate of economic growth, a deterioration in the terms of trade, the stagnation of trade, a decrease in the prices of raw materials, high interest rates and increasing protectionism by the industrialized nations, together with the reduction of international economic aid and cooperation  to give just one revealing example, the increase in the gross national product barely reached per cent in the industrialized countries for and  and it will probably be at zero in  this has produced a considerable increase in unemployment and thereby a drasticreduction in the demand for the products and raw materials on the export of which the existence of the third world depends although this problem affects all countries, it is undeniable that the countries within the underdeveloped group that do not produce oil are those that suffer most as a result of the present international economic crisis  in fact, in real terms, the prices of our commodities have reached the lowest level recorded in the last three decades and are substantially lower than those that prevailed during the recession of the mid  the most important consequence of this situation for the underdeveloped countries that do not produce oil is that in most of tl cm real per capita income has been drastically reduced for the first time since the second world war this situation has created a grave imbalance in the external sector of our economies characterized by high deficits, for which we have been compelled to compensate with unprecedented increases in our foreign debt  this high level of debt today constitutes one of the most serious threats to the financial stability of many nations  we want to use this international forum to request the flexibility that the international banking community must show as regards the repayment of those debts, because it must be remembered that they have been caused by a very unusual economic situation we support the conclusions set forth at the recent meeting of the world bank and the international monetary fund in toronto stressing the enormous responsibility now facing the main industrialized countries as regards the recovery of their economies, the reduction of present interest rates and reversal of the present isolationist trend so as to bring about closer and more generalized international cooperation we also propose the study and identification of proper recommendations to curtail the increasing protectionist trend in industrialized nations, which manifests itself in the establishment of unjustified trade barriers that obstruct international trade and limit the expansion of markets for the products of the third world nations in other words our delegation considers that the northsouth dialogue must be awakened from its present stagnation and be activated as an instrument for frank discussions concerning the contradictions between the developed and the developing worlds  the present condition of the international economy reveals symptoms similartoo similar to be ignored to those that existed before the world depression of the , whose disastrous consequences we all know let us pledge that during the current decade, through global negotiations within the framework of the organization, those indispensable measures required for the achievement of the much awaited new international economic order will be taken and make it possible for us to live in a more secure and just world as we examine the problems that affect the international community, we cannot forget the danger posed by the policies of increasing armaments pursued by the superpowers  our concern increases when we observe with anxiety and frustration the paralysis of negotiations on disarmament and the fact that we cannot foresee the establishment of a new order that will give peace to the world  it is a paradox that while the great nations argue over formulas to reduce the tremendous power of their forces of mutual destruction new installations with nuclear missiles of incalculable efficiency are being set up on their territories  if this latent menace became reality, it would imply the total destruction of the world that we live in  the danger becomes greater with the outbreak of limited conflicts in sensitive areas of the world, conflicts that could easily become uncontrollable and result in a nuclear holocaust in this situation of extreme danger to all mankind, there is an urgent need for all member states to act together to create the proper climate for constructive dialogue between the big world powers one of the dangers is the explosive situation of increasing violence in the middle east which during recent decades has been a negative factor for the prospects for balance and peace in the world  the seriousness of the situation has been made tragically evident by the recent horrible massacre of palestinian refugees in the camps of lebanon, a dreadful act of genocide that has shaken the conscience of the entire international community  our government has publicly emphatically condemned that horrible massacre, and has demanded that international bodies prevent its repetition and determine responsibility for it our voice has joined those of other nations clamouring for an effective guarantee of the integrity and sovereignty of lebanon, an unfortunate country with which we have very cordial relations  we are aware that the problems in that area of conflict have demonstrated that the palestinian question is one of the decisive factors in the crisis  we believe that no permanent, serious solution can be reached if we do not provide a mechanism that assures the palestinian people the exercise of its inalienable right to self determination, which has been recognized by the united nations similarly, we reiterate our policy that any serious attempt to achieve peace and coexistence in that tormented region must take into account security council resolution (, which, among other things, affirms the state of israel right to exist we regard as timely and essential to the peace effort the proposal made by the secretarygeneral to convert the security council into a world forum where all the parties concerned in the problem of the middle east may sit at the same negotiating table the dominican republic feels closely linked to the arab world by the strong connections created by the historical emigrations to our territory of syrian, lebanese and palestinian citizens, who have enriched the cultural, social and economic heritage of our country over the years  consequently, my government has affirmed its determination to establish or strengthen political, economic and other ties with many of the countries of the arab world, within the framework of international law and the principles of the charter the war between iraq and the islamic republic of iran, an unfortunate confrontation between two moslem countries, is a cause of deep concern to us  we hope that a solution will be found in the near future, one restoring peace and making possible a policy of goodneighbourliness, with the full guarantee of reciprocal rightswithin the framework of the united nations, of course fundamentally, the composition of the dominican people is the product of an interracial union of indians, whites and blacks  the result of this ethnic mixture is a mixed race of which we are truly proud  the dominican republic reiterates in this world forum that for us any kind of discrimination or segregation, any attempt to separate the population on racial, religious or other lines, is a crime against humanity  therefore, we reject the policies and practices of apartheid  we take this opportunity to affirm that the dominican republic condemns without reservation violations of human rights in whatever circumstances and wherever they occur our profound conviction on the matter and our resulting firm rejection of such attempts have a special meaning at this particular time, when we have just inaugurated in the city of santo domingo a monument to brother antonio montesinos  a magnificent work architecturally and sculpturally, the monument is a gift from the government of mexico to the people of the dominican republic  brother antonio montesinos proclaimed in a sermon in our island in  by what right and with what justice do you keep these indians under such horrible servitude  are they not men  have they not rational spirits  that was his cry of concern from santo domingo, the first act in defence of human rights in the new world on october, hispanic day, our president, at the inauguration of the monument, recalled that pronouncement and its farreaching consequences when, in the presence of president jose lopez portillo of mexico,he said: the rights of man, which, under another name, brother antonio montesinos fought for, have been a permanent guiding light for the dominican people  even in those dark days when liberty was denied to us, the pursuit of freedom became the principal motive which unified our wills, criteria and actions  only time has separated those historic moments of the struggle for liberty and democracy in our country  our political democracy, today fully achieved, may be the great answer to those struggles and to a full awareness of them, and the role this plays within our continent geographical differences do not prevent us from recalling the struggles of other peoples, however distant they may be from the antilles  we support the efforts of the people of namibia to regain its independence  we also express our concern about foreign interventions in afghanistan and kampuchea  we hope that through peaceful dialogue and the use of the machinery provided by the charter the korean people may be able to secure their desired unification into one sovereign state at this time, when territories are the source of stillunresolved conflicts and problems, the seas may contribute to the wellbeing of the world  we are now witnessing the humanization of the seas through the third united nations conference on the law of the sea that declared the seabed to be the common heritage of all mankind  the conference was one of the great successes of the general assembly and proof of this body effectiveness within the united nations  since  when the conference on the law of the sea began, it has been working with a new vision of international law and cooperation and is laying down rules that would satisfy our aspirations to abolish privileges, to protect the environment and to achieve peaceful coexistence  the new convention on the law of the sea, in establishing a new and fruitful reality, is an example of the infinite possibilities inherent in negotiation, good will and mutual understanding among the social items on the agenda of the assembly, the dominican republic considers as being particularly relevant those related to the rights, evolution and development of women as well as to their participation in the political, social and economic life of their countries  in this connection, the new dominican government has set up an office for the advancement of women within a ministry of social welfare as a first step towards integration of the different aspects of human advancement  we express our deep satisfaction at the fact that our country has been selected as host to the international research and training institute for the advancement of women, whose formal installation will take place early next year in santo domingo and for which the dominican government has already made a substantial appropriation we are confident that the report the secretary general will submit with regard to this matter, which has already been endorsed by the economic and social council, will prompt other member states to contribute to the support of this institute and thereby assure the fulfilment of its important functions under the present difficult international circumstances, cultural cooperationwidely debated and defined at the world conference on cultural policies, known as mondiacult, organized by unesco in augustis evoked to strengthen the ties that exist between peoples  there can be no argument that all cultures have the same dignity and equality; that freedom is necessary to all intellectual and artistic creation; that all patrimonies, be they architectonic, written or oral, need to be protected and that those values are the bedrock of an interdependence freely assumed but carefully preserving identities and receptive to new sources of enrichment the dominican republic, which suffered for a long time from cultural isolationism, now wishes to develop communication in education, science, literature and art, provided such dialogues between cultures are established on a basis of respect and reciprocity, of recognition and a receptiveness that assures interchange in the true meaning of that word  we wish to strengthen regional ties, the mutual recognition of cultures, the resources and unique expressions of the peoples of central america and the caribbean  to this end, the dominican republic has proposed the celebration of the first biennial of visual arts in the caribbean, to be held in santo domingo, a recommendation that was approved by the general assembly of mondiacult however, this wish for a greater closeness to the countries of our region and latin america does not diminish the lively interest of the dominican republic in extracontinental cultural cooperation and the recognition of great historical events of the past that still loom large today  we refer to the fifth centenary of the discovery of america, and we are grateful to the spanish foreign minister for mentioning in his statement the dominican republic initiative in proposing that the united nations general assembly declare, in a universal context, that be proclaimed the year of the fifth centenary of the discovery of america the united nations was founded on the ruins of that great catastrophe that history has called the second world war  the organization was conceived to guarantee international peace, to develop friendship among peoples, to assure selfdetermination and to promote, through international cooperation, their social, economic and cultural development  the organization was conceived in support of human dignity, on the basis of respect for the rights and fundamental freedoms of all mankind without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion  the organization was conceived to prevent the thirdand probably the lastworld war we often forget that the founders, our predecessors who signed the charter of san francisco, did so in the name of peoples, not in the name of states or governments  this is not a semantic artifice, nor is it a legal subtlety  it is simply the living expression of a deep longing for peace and solidarity that was born in the universal conscience in those dark days  i believe that many of the problems arise or worsen because governments sometimes ignore the real aspirations of their peoples  people have among themselves spontaneous affinities, natural and pure, that are deeply rooted in their cultural origins and common ideals  those affinities transcend the boundaries of circumstantial antagonisms that are characteristic of the strict exercise of government  ah governments, regardless of ideology or of geopolitical location, would render a great service to the organization vocation for peace should they decide to stimulate the development of those affinities, whose roots are found in the very depth of human awareness  a simple examination of the agenda of the assembly, a mere study of the multiple conflicts that divide the international community, the anguish expressed by the brave declaration of the secretary general in his memorable report, will surely prove that we have not yet reached these ideals  however, those harsh realities must not frustrate us to the point of losing faith in the organization, for if we have not been able in many cases to prevent or to solve conflicts, we have at other times had successes that constitute true triumphs for mankind in this connection, it should be pointed out that if the fear of a nuclear holocaust is still the gravest threat to mankind today, there is no better hope of preventing it than that offered by this exalted forum, open without discrimination or prejudice to all the peoples and nations of the world the imperfections of the organization must not shatter our faith in it  on the contrary, they should inspire us to overcome them, thus strengthening our confidence in its capacity to fulfil its objectives  this is the best contribution we can offer to the future of mankind  \\ufeff  i should like at the very outset to express the feeling of admiration and respect with which my country joins in the tribute paid recently to the secretarygeneral, dag hammarskjold, in his own native land, by all the nations of the free world, a tribute to a man who died tragically in the service of the brightest ideal of modern mankind— that of universal peace and concord  the finest tribute that could be paid to this extraordinary man, this standardbearer of peace, this apostle of brotherhood, would be to have all the nations represented here join selflessly in choosing as his successor someone capable of serving the united nations with the same lofty spirit of selfsacrifice as he displayed in the cause of furthering the unity and solidarity of the human family  this tribute would also be extended to the great swedish nation, which has given this world organization two martyrs: count bernadotte, who fell heroically in the deserts of the middle east, and now dag hammarskjold, struck down by the same fatality which has pursued all redeemers since god himself died on the cross to give us an example of the power of blood to inspire great causes and great human ideals for perhaps the first time in the history of the united nations, a country of the americas is reentering this world organization after having acquired the moral licence to belong to an institution founded precisely to defend the right of man to live in a world free from fear and injustice  the dominican republic has been a member of the united nations since the organization inception in  but it is only now, after years of purely theoretical adherence to the principles of the san francisco charter, that, in full awareness of its duties and responsibilities, it is really entering this world forum which should count among its members only those nations for which international agreements are not a myth, and human rights not a fiction  after the fall of the man who for thirty years personified the dominican state, we established in our country a regime which is based on the rule of law and which has gradually been modelling its institutions on the pattern of representative democracy  instead of the single party, as we find in countries where political activity is reduced to directives handed down by a totalitarian authority, various competing parties have emerged, parties in which the divergent ideals and desires of the dominican people have at last found expression, fundamental civil rights, without which freedom and civil order are inconceivable, have been extended to all citizens who now, after thirtyone years of political obscurantism, freely exercise their constitutional rights and privileges  the iron curtain which encircled the island, and through which independent opinion could scarcely filter, has been lifted, and the right to travel freely has been accorded to three million people who were virtually cut off from international political life and from world civilization  today, no arbitrary requirements obstruct the issuance of passports and visas to enter and leave dominican territory  this political realignment of our country with the countries of the free world has been strengthened by the emergence and consolidation of political organizations which carry on their public activities free from arbitrary restrictions, and which fully enjoy the right of peaceful association and the right to elect and to be elected in genuine elections supervised internationally and conducted with exemplary impartiality with the technical help of experts recommended by the secretariat of the organization of american states  in addition to these decisive steps in the area of political reconstruction, we have taken other no less important steps to promote free enterprise and to rid our economy of all reactionary controls  the monopolies that benefited individuals and the enterprises established to divert much of the nation economic activity towards selfish ends are being eliminated, and the widest freedom is being  restored to business and private initiative  a series of new laws, drafted in a broad spirit of social justice has been enacted to abolish all taxes which in the past weighed heavily on the consumer and made it practically impossible for the poorer classes to subsist  the basic commodities in our export trade have been brought under a new system of duties which channels most of the state revenue towards the farmers the institutional life of the country has been reorganized on a truly liberal basis  noteworthy accomplishments in this field include the law which restores full administrative authority to municipal councils and reestablishes the unrestricted principle of autonomy of municipal corporations, the law which establishes the independence of the university and reinstates the principle of academic freedom in the oldest institution of higher learning in the americas; the bill to enforce the constitutional principle of the separation of powers and ensure the tenure of judges and the independence of the judiciary — the basis of civil order in any civilized country; and lastly the laws designed to organize the juridical system and to endow the nation with a political physiognomy of a thoroughly republican character,thus, a government based on law is coming into being in the dominica republic  the dictatorship has collapsed, and on its ruins we have begun to build, patiently and without demagogic show, a regime cast in the forms which we inherited from the founders of the republic and which are basically the same as the timehonoured forms fashioned by the creative genius of bolivar, san martin, washington, o'higgins, morazon, juarez, marti and other great heroes of american independence  this is why i stand here unabashed and speak with a clear conscience and with no fear of offending the memory of my country founding fathers, whose solemn rights we have vindicated and whose unfading legacy we have kept pure as the metal used to case the bells of resurgence  the case of the dominican republic is heartening proof that democracy isteadily gaining ground in the americas and that, despite the poverty which afflicts most of our peoples, despite the distress which ravages our unblessed masses and the difficulties placed by our underdevelopment in the way of our progress towards the high goals of justice, despite all this we are resolutely advancing towards that hardwon ideal achieved in the americas by only the few nations which can honestly affirm that the lands of the hemisphere are infertile for dictatorship and oppression the openly conducted process of abolishing all our primitive political methods and of liberalizing our institutions is not, of course, proceeding without impediments or limitations  there are negative elements which are opposing this process of democratization with all the ferocity of their barbarian instincts  in addition, the opposition movements which have once more become part of the republic life lack the necessary civic maturity and frequently transgress the limits of the law, openly violating public order and wilfully disregarding the legitimate authority of the state  the new government, which in effect emerged after the tragedy of may, for only then was it free of the imperious will which for thirty years weighed heavily on the life of men and institutions, is doing everything in its power to offset these two influences which consciously or unconsciously conspire against the rule of law which we wish to establish for our own sake and for the sake of future generations  the suppressed feelings of rebellion and dissent which the dictatorship bred in the masses of the population have burst loose in the country, shattering the controls imposed by many years of christian teaching on the populace tormented by long decades of terror  blood has flowed often, placing its deadly mark on the outbursts of violence, the public rostrum and the balcony overlooking the public square have been used for bitter haranguing and for the flagwaving of professional agitators  but the process has begun, and nothing and nobody can restrain the yearning for political regeneration which is sweeping through the national consciousness with the force of a mighty torrent, it is essential that this political phenomenon should be seen without prejudice and that world public opinion should view it with the sympathy it deserves, as a sincere effort to return an american nation to functional democracy and genuine freedom for over a year the dominican republic has been under a severe sentence of banishment which condemns it, like a pestilenceridden country, to economic strangulation and diplomatic ostracism, the sixth meeting of consultation of foreign ministers, which met at san jos costa rica, in  meted out a punishment to us upon the justice and propriety of which i shall not dwell for the moment  as everybody knows, we were condemned on that occasion for having interfered in the internal affairs of a sister nation and for having committed a political crime against a distinguished latin american statesman  i am not denying that that action, in violation of the principle of nonintervention, the bulwark of inter american relations, and that censurable deed which almost cost the life of one of the leaders of hemispheric democracy, deserved to be punished  but it is not fair that the punishment should outlive the culprit and that an institution characteristic of the stone age, when the sons were held responsible for the sins of their fathers and the gates of the accursed cities were painted with the stigma inri, should he written into international law  the action against which sanctions were taken at san josis a thing of the past  the whole of america rejected it, but failed to appreciate that a sentence condemning a personal act, born of the enmity between two political rivals, cannot be applied to a people and to future generations who were not responsible for it; those who perpetrated or inspired it are now in their graves awaiting the verdict of history almost at the same time as the dominican republic, another latin american country stood in the prisoner box at san jose, costa rica  the action taken with respect to our country, accused of being a rightist dictatorship and doubtless the most efficient but the most rigid and implacable of all we have known in american in the past century, was exemplary and drastic  but there were no censure or sanctions against the other country, ruled by a leftist dictatorship in which the interest of a foreign power takes precedence over true interests of the american continent, because such measures were deemed incompatible with the principle of nonintervention and respect for national sovereignty  now, more than a year later, these contradictions continue to exist and to weaken the faith of our peoples in hemispheric justice and in the effectiveness of the efforts we have exerted for over sixty years to establish inter american relations on a basis of international honour  if only to prevent that difference in the treatment of two small countries situated in the same geographical area from continuing to irritate that sector of latin american public opinion which is still sensitive enough to protest against the injustice of any discrimination, this monstrous anomaly should be eliminated, wheni speak of cuba, i am not censuring that country or challenging its right to determine its own future and to choose its own political institutions  that right is beyond all dispute and it would be absurd to challenge it from the rostrum of an organization which was created precisely in order to defend the self determination of peoples and to restrain the imperialist designs of the great nations of the world  the impassioned figure of fidel castro, the sanguinary prophet of the sierra maestra, and the nature of his regime, are not matters to be discussed outside the regional context in a world assembly of free nations where it is assumed that every country has the inalienable right to decide freely whether to serve the god of the hammer and the sickle or continue to cast its lot with traditional christian civilization,this, i feel, is an appropriate time to declare solemnly that the episode for which we were condemned at san josis a permanently closed chapter in the history of our international relations  the countries represented in this assembly may be sure that the present dominican government will not commit any act which may be regarded as interference, however slight, in matters which come within the sovereignty of other american states  we should also like to declare solemnly and irrevocably in this assembly that the new dominican government henceforth accepts the jurisdiction of the commission on human rights, of the organization of american states and of the united nations  our unreserved acceptance of those organs and of the principles which they represent, as guardians of the inviolable rights of the individual and as guarantors in america and in the world of the dignity of the human person, shall henceforth be judged in the light of events which have occurred or may occur in the dominican republic after july  the date which marked the beginning of the lawful state, for whose political and moral solvency we assume responsibility  following the tragic events of may, there was a period of approximately one month when the government authorities were virtually powerless to control the wave of reprisals and violence unleashed throughout the country in the confusion created in dominican society by that overwhelming event  i should make one last statement with regard to this matter in all sincerity and with the same firmness: with or without sanctions, with or without the injustice of san jose, the dominican republic will continue to be unswervingly loyal to the destiny of america, a destiny which is identified with that of the united states so long as the united states fulfils its task of defending the freedom of the world and of safeguarding our civilization, even at the risk of its own survival the political transformation which our country has undergone and the ideology which prevails among its people and in its institutions are the keys to our position with respect to the world problems with which this assembly is to deal  on each of these questions— prohibition of nuclear weapons, german reunification, elimination of the last vestiges, of colonialism in africa, the aggressions in asia laos, cambodia, etc — our position can only be one of full support of the western democracies having clarified that point, which is so evident as not to require any clarification, x would beg leave to make a few remarks on the problems of my own country, which is as important to america as laos is to asia or nigeria to the future of the african continent it is imperative that the world should follow attentively the events now taking place in the dominican republic  the danger of total disintegration which threatens the american 'continent is not in cuba, which may already be irremediably lost to western civilization, but in the dominican republic, where another crack in the edifice of america might have disastrous consequences for the future of the hemisphere and its collective security  these are not mere conjectures or empty words  our country is today an unknown factor and its future is surrounded by enigmas  what is brewing there cannot be foreseen or analysed  a people subjected for thirtyone years to one of the most ironfisted dictatorships known in our time is anxiously seeking the way to its final redemption  but there are many elements working against that endeavour in the midst of a particularly difficult and complex situation,the instinct of the masses, who want freedom but confuse it with licence and anarchy, is being frustrated in my country by thirty years of political barbarity  the precarious conditions in which our political stability is being developed are aggravated by economic poverty which, in our country as everywhere, is the great catalyst of social crisis, the whole atmosphere is fraught with explosive factors and revolutionary ferment, ours is a people which, like all latin american peoples, has an irrepressible taste for polities and hopes for a better life without any dear idea of how to achieve its goals  the oppressed middleclass, intelligent and ambitious, many of whom have risen by the hard road of a university education, and whose desire to succeed is often frustrated because of lack of opportunities for employment and for earning a livelihood by practising their professions, emphatically condemns poverty and economic injustice, but it suffers from the lack of direction as the working classes add to that dramatic picture the fact that the whole population is increasing at an alarming rate and that there is not enough employment for about half a million frustrated workers, professional men, students and farmers, who are migrating to the city and being lured by their illusory hopes into its treacherous maw all that social, political and economic disintegration, inherited from a highly constructive dictatorship which was undermined towards the end fey internal disaffection and physical waste, can be exploited by communism to establish another agency of the kremlin in the american balkans the opposition political parties and movements have resorted to an intemperate demagogy which has thus far proved incapable of drawing up a programme or of being guided by the principles of constructive action, and the precarious position of the government, shaken by the constant threat of rebellion and coups d'etat, is creating a special psychology which is preparing the whole island for an almost inevitable upheaval this potentially explosive material, fashioned over thirty years by a totalitarian concept of the economy, human life and social and political relations, is exploited by professional agitators whose objective is not necessarily to seize power, but to prevent the consolidation of any power and the growth of any real democracy within the framework of a christian and genuinely legal organization of the state,it is essential, therefore, that america should watch what is happening in the dominican republic today  the political phenomenon developing there must be observed with true objectivity if communism is to be prevented from piercing that flank of the caribbean and reaching the very heart of america, that america which should not forget that it was through the caribbean, through that stormy sea which humboldt compared to a manymouthed mediterranean, that the new barbarians, the implacable enemies of american democracy, came to our shores i may have taken more time than my country merits to set forth the case of the dominican republic, if we compare its conflicts and interests with the serious problems which the united nations is called upon to consider and resolve in this assembly  it is obvious, however, that the future of the dominican republic should be of concern not only to america but to this world organization, which had its origin, so to speak, in that tiny corner of the american continent  america is indebted to my country for countless spiritual treasures  it was in our old university, the oldest in the new world, that the first humanists in america were educated—from the first rector of the university of caracas, established in  and the first rector of the university of havana, founded in  to the heroes of the spiritual conquest of america; the descendants of bishop ramirez de fuenleal, founder of the first american school in which latin grammar was taught, and the men who carried on the humanist tradition of alejandro geraldini, who, soon after he came to the island, wrote an ode in classic verse to the first university of the new world  but what the dominicans can be most proud of is not their labour to nurture the spirit and their old university, full of historic parchments and symbol of the immortal radiance with which the beacons of culture illuminate the races of man  greater than those honours is the glory of having served as the scene of that crucial event which produced the whole idea of the united nations, an idea which has been in the process of gestation since the most important concept of modern times penetrated the universal conscience, namely, the concept of the, freedom of the individual for it was precisely among the first generation born to the daughters of spain, on the ancestral soil of santo domingo de la espaniola, that the vital question of individual liberty, the greatest achievement and the most significant political fact to emerge in the first twenty centuries of the christian era, was first discussed  that achievement, greater than the exploit of the illustrious navigator who broke through the pillars of hercules with the keel of his vessels and whose discovery dispelled the shadows of the dark sea,  was the work of a humble monk, author of the sermon of the advent, who was later to work with francisco de vitoria, the spanish socrates, to embody in public international law the fundamental concept of the inviolability of the rights of the/ individual that missionary was called fray pedro de cordoba and his arrival on the island of santo domingo is comparable in the history of america to saint paul arrival at athens, when the idols came crashing down from their pedestals and the cross on the breast of that apostle of human brotherhood opened its arms before all the people to promise men of good will not only that they should inherit the earth, but they should enter the kingdom of heaven and of infinite hope  thus the doctrine on which this world organization is founded was born in santo domingo, for it was there that an illustrious precursor of the great spanish theologians of the renaissance first proclaimed the right of everyone, including the aborigines of america, who were still on the fringe of civilization, to enjoy the rights which were thenceforth regarded as superior to any reason of state that assertion, solemnly proclaimed from the pulpit of an obscure hermitage on the island of hispaniola, set off the most significant controversy in history  while we have passed judgement on it, we have still not resolved it because the drama of man today, the drama of the united nations, amounts in essence to a struggle between the right of the individual to enjoy his fundamental rights in full freedom in accordance with the christian concept of human destiny, and the attempts of totalitarian governments to subjugate him in the name of political logic and social expediency international society, which was still dominated by the spirit of the middle ages, with its anachronistic concept of a world divided between two great powers, church and state, began to undergo basic changes under the influence of the humble spanish monk who started the crusade in santo domingo for the freedom of the indigenous peoples and who enriched jurisprudence from that day forward by introducing a new idealistic and theological concept of the unity of the human family,before concluding, i should like to take the liberty of recalling from this rostrum the work and the teachings  of those humble missionaries of the old island of hispaniola, so that the united nations, guided by the example of that group of religious men who have the honour of having been the first civilisers of the continent, may continue to seek peace, strengthened by faith in god and inspired by the beautiful ideal of human brotherhood a few centuries later, in his address of january  eightyseven years after the united states had won its independence, abraham lincoln, an apostolic figure who symbolizes the equality of men and of civic rights, condemned violence, called for reconciliation among his countrymen and urged that all conflicts between peoples should be resolved by righteousness of man and the grace of almighty god,may his lofty example and the words of his unforgettable address in guide this general assembly in bringing the ship of peace, now anchored on the shores of the hudson, into all ports and all continents where the peoples are awaiting it, with the message which will revive the hope which has waned in the hearts of men  \\ufeffon behalf of the dominican republic andits president mr  leonel fernandez reyna, i wish toconvey to our president our warmest congratulations onhis well deserved election to preside over this fiftysecondsession of the general assembly, at a time when theorganization is taking important steps forward in its restructuring and modernization in order to meet thechallenges of peace and economic and social developmentfor our nations our delegation pays tribute to the outgoingpresident, his excellency mr  razali ismail, for hisoutstanding conduct of the deliberations during the lastsession of the general assembly we take this opportunity to express our gratitude tothe secretarygeneral, mr  kofi annan, for his assiduity,dedication and hard work in guiding the organization downa road of reform and modernization that will make itstronger for the new millennium while remaining faithful to the purposes and principlesset forth in the charter — the maintenance of internationalpeace and security, cooperation for economic, social andcultural development, defence of human rights, andhumanitarian assistance — the united nations should alsopromote and pursue a reform process which takes intoaccount the many changes that have taken place in acomplex international scene  that scene is marked by theend of ideological confrontations and, at the same time, byincreasing levels of poverty and ethnic and religioustension, phenomena that pose a threat to our supremeobjectives of peace and development for our peoples the trend within the organization in recent years tothe establishment of working groups, as well as the reportof the secretarygeneral entitled “renewing the unitednations: a programme for reform”, reflect the strongresolve of member states to engage in a negotiation andconsultation process that could, once their distrust of thepast is overcome, culminate in farreaching changes in thevarious united nations bodies  the dominican republicattaches special importance to the ongoing reform process,given that it is capable, while respecting the principles andpurposes that gave birth to the organization, of ensuring amore democratic, transparent, representative and efficientsystem capable of facing the current challenges, especiallythose of peace and the problems of poverty that affect thepeoples of the world in this regard, the strengthening of the generalassembly, the main forum in which member states arerepresented, cannot be postponed  it is imperative topromote a process of better coordination between theassembly and the security council, so that the assemblycan be properly informed, and hence make betterrecommendations to the security council aware of the need to strengthen the united nations,the dominican republic calls on this forum to adoptresolutions that can return to the assembly its capacity asthe governing body of the organization  in this regard, wewelcome the proposals of the secretarygeneral designed tofocus the work of the assembly on the highestpriorityissues and to reduce the duration of its sessions as well asthe number of agenda items, so as to allow for their indepth study this reorientation should not interfere with theprinciple of sovereign equality, nor with the plural anduniversal character that the organization has maintainedover the more than half a century of its existence reaffirmation of the democratic principles contained inthe charter must constitute the basis for the currentreform process the dominican republic proposes the establishmentof mechanisms and working methods that would enablethe assembly to allow reasonable time for makingprogress on resolving certain conflicts  the problems ofpeace, security and development are multiple andcomplex  however, the commitment of the internationalcommunity expressed in the united nations should gobeyond merely recalling them each year the aspect of the reform of the organization that hasraised the greatest debate is the one relating to therestructuring and enlargement of the security council our country hopes that these reforms will promote greaterparticipation by the membership as a whole  thus, witha more democratic base and a just and equitable selectionprocess, the council would be in a better position to meetits purposes and objectives  in this regard, the dominicanrepublic proposes the expansion of the security councilfrom the current to members  this represents lessthan per cent of the total number of united nationsmember states, whereas in the figure was slightlyabove per cent the dominican republic, a founding member of theunited nations, has not yet been a member of thesecurity council  in this new phase of its internationalrelations it has a strong interest in participating activelyin bodies such as the security council and thus makinga direct contribution to the maintenance of peace, onwhich depends the very existence of nations an encouraging sign in the proposal of thesecretarygeneral is that the reforms are constantlyrelated to the achievement of the founding principles ofthe organization, as expressed in the charter  thus, theresults of reform will be assessed primarily not on thebasis of the relationship of costs to benefits, but rather onhow they facilitate the realization of the organization’sobjectives our country supports the restructuring of theorganization as long as it promotes more transparent,clearer and more coherent mandates and is directedtowards finding lasting solutions to the problems ofhunger, underdevelopment, extreme poverty and socialinjustice, not forgetting the mandates related topeacekeeping allow me to refer to the issue of development  theincrease in global poverty and the gap between rich andpoor countries is today the crucial problem for theinternational community  poverty has a negative impact onprogress with regard to peace and security, human rightsand the strengthening of democratic systems  we mustaddress forthwith the challenge posed by the tremendouseconomic and social instability of a large number ofcountries the dominican delegation associates itself with thedeclarations of the group of adopted in july of this year,at the twentysecond meeting of the group coordinators,because we support strengthening the role of the unitednations in promoting international cooperation for socialand economic development  and we are in favour ofmeasures that will promote the formulation andcoordination of policies and the provision of technicalassistance to developing countries our country is making serious efforts to position itselffavourably in the world economy and to prepare forglobalization  for this purpose, it is currently conductingmajor economic, monetary, tariff and judicial reforms,while at the same time negotiating freetrade agreementswith countries of the region  also, together with othercountries, it is formulating strategies to take advantage offunds from multilateral sources the achievements of regional groups such as thecentral american common market, the caribbeancommunity (caricom), the andean group and thesouthern cone common market (mercosur), amongothers, are indications of the strong willingness of themember states to expand their capacities and reduce thenegative impact that the new rules of international tradehave on our economies and societies aware of the commitment to promote at the regionallevel mechanisms for improving economic growth andcombating poverty, the dominican republic has in the pastyear strengthened its relations with the countries ofcaricom and central america, primarily through theparticipation of our president in the meetings of heads ofstate and government  we are pleased to announce that ourcountry will host the next summit meeting of centralamerica, belize and the dominican republic and thatnegotiations for the establishment of a freetrade areabetween caricom and the dominican republic shouldbe concluded by the end of this year at this time allow me to welcome veryenthusiastically the initiatives of the group of centralamerican countries designed to strengthen centralamerican unity  it is precisely these efforts that havegiven us faith and confidence in the future of our peoples during this year, the dominican republic hasdeveloped a programme for strengthening our links withour neighbouring country, haiti  for the first time, binational joint commissions are crossing the border to find,through dialogue, areas of mutual interest and solutions tosome of the problems common to both countries regarding our sister republic of haiti, we insist onthe need for the international community to dischargeeffectively the economic commitment it made in with regard to haiti’s economic recovery anddevelopment  the peacekeeping efforts in haiti, which wehave promoted in the united nations, will not besufficient to achieve democratic stability unless they areaccompanied by resources directed to alleviating the greateconomic and social problems affecting that nation we must again emphasize how external debt isweighing down our economies  the onerous costs ofdebtservicing hinder our investing more in our peoples,thus deepening the levels of poverty  for the dominicanrepublic, the payment of outstanding debts and theinterest on them represents nearly per cent of thenational budget  as a means of promoting developmentand social investment projects to combat poverty, we wishto propose to this assembly that it take the necessaryactions to reduce the burden of the external debt in thosedeveloping countries that have demonstrated a high levelof responsibility in handling their debt we reiterate the commitment of the united nationsto develop efficient measures for the struggle againstpoverty  along with peacekeeping, developmentcooperation must constitute an overarching goal of theorganization  no financing of activities for peacekeeping,the defence of human rights or humanitarian actions willbe sufficient if we do not act responsibly in undertakingmultilateral cooperation for development the proposal to unify the various programmes of theunited nations devoted to development seems to us to bea very important step towards the effective coordinationof intersectoral policies, concentrating strategies anddevelopment operations in a united nations developmentgroup  these initiatives must reorient resources towardareas of priority and achieve better coordination withinternational funding organizations allow me to express the position of my countryregarding the evolution of the international situation  peaceis still among the highest aspiration of our peoples different points of the planet are currently involved inbloody conflicts which affect common citizens  security istoday not only a matter of the survival of political regimes,but is linked to the very existence of human beings andnature the dominican republic expresses its solidarity withthe many conventions of the international communitydevoted to eradicating corruption, terrorism, drug traffickingand money laundering  these evils disrupt the lives of ourpeoples, erode our institutions and prevent the strengtheningof democracy we reiterate our conviction regarding the defence ofdemocratic principles and institutionality  in this regard, mycountry is making tremendous efforts to reform andmodernize the state and the judicial system  establishingmeans of promoting a transparent public administration,controlling all forms of administrative corruption, is amongthe ongoing processes in our nation  dialogue and thesearch for consensus among the branches of the state andbetween the executive branch and civil society have becomethe polestar of public administration of the dominicangovernment the dominican republic welcomes and associatesitself with the measures taken by the united nations toextend the presence of the peacekeeping forces in haiti their presence, we believe, strengthens the possibilities fordemocratic stability and will allow the people to take suresteps on the road towards consolidating the country’sdemocracy we stress the need for a definitive and peacefulsolution to the conflict in the balkans, and we call upon theinternational community to strengthen its efforts to achievepeace in the middle east  the crisis in that region, whichhas deteriorated in recent months, demands specialattention  we call for respect for all the agreements signedin recent years in order to restore peace in the region with regard to the republic of china on taiwan, thedominican republic reiterates its position as presented byour president, dr  leonel fernandez reyna, regarding theneed for the international community to consider theimportance of that country, owing to its geographicallocation and given the fact that security and stability areof great significance for the peace and prosperity of theregion  we call for a constructive dialogue between thetwo sides of the strait of taiwan in search of mutualunderstanding and cooperation  we reiterate that parallelparticipation of both countries in the united nationswould contribute to the maintenance of peace our country supports the efforts under way invarious international conferences in brussels, oslo, andvery soon in ottawa, regarding the process to achieve atotal ban an antipersonnel landmines  the commitmentto peace is a commitment to life  the internationalcommunity has an obligation to promote peace and todefend life in all situations and circumstances the dominican republic, traditionally a peaceoriented nation, does not produce or consume nuclearenergy for military purposes; it utilizes such energy forpeaceful purposes  in this spirit, the dominican presidentsigned the comprehensive nucleartestban treatyduring his visit to the united nations last year various international conferences are currentlydiscussing conventions on the use of nuclear energy  oneof them is the convention to regulate the harm caused topersons and the environment by radioactive waste  thedominican republic depends to a large extent on tourism,a tourism of beaches and sun  the quality of our coastalwaters is vital for the sector’s development, and anyinternational radioactivityrelated damage can mean thecollapse of this important sector of our economy  weappeal to the good judgement of the internationalcommunity to preserve our natural resources we reaffirm our commitment to the protection of theenvironment and natural resources  in this spirit, ourcountry has acceded to the united nations internationalconvention to combat desertification the dominican republic reiterates its commitmentto defending and protecting human rights  in thisconnection, it welcomes the efforts made by the unitednations to concentrate the activities of the office of thehigh commissioner for human rights and the centre forhuman rights  during this year we have had thesatisfaction of receiving two international missions onhuman rights, invited by our government  a highlevelmission of the interamerican committee on humanrights (ichr), of the organization of american states,visited the country in june, and a mission of the committeeof the international covenant on economic, social andcultural rights of the united nations, with headquarters ingeneva, is in the country at this very moment  these visitsindicate the government’s interest in ensuring transparencyof action to defend and protect human rights in thedominican republic allow me to refer to the situation of the unitednations international research and training institute for theadvancement of women  our country wishes to reiteratethe mandate given in economic and social councilresolution of may  in which it is clearlyand explicitly stated that the headquarters of the institutewould be established in the dominican republic, adeveloping country the objectives that led to the creation of the instituteare still valid today  research and training for the purposeof creating new ways for women to contribute to thedevelopment of their countries, in the light of women’sneeds, are a priority  this concern was manifested at thebeijing conference of and in the platform for actionto follow up the agreements reached in that importantforum in order to cooperate with the united nations, thedominican government not only donated the buildinghousing the institute but also invested large amounts ofmoney to renovate the building and adapt it to theinstitute’s needs  this explains our surprise when, in the united nations secretariat proposed the merger of theinstitute and the united nations development fund forwomen (unifem), without prior consultation with ourgovernment and ignoring the headquarters agreement however, in the fourth world conference onwomen, in its beijing platform for action, confirmed theinstitute’s mandate we hope that in the process of united nations reformall the mandates approved by the member states will beequally respected, since these states bear sole responsibilityfor renewing or changing decisions adopted by the generalassembly lastly, we welcome the summoning of member statesto reflect on and endorse these transformations in our worldorganization  the assembly of the millennium proposed tous for the year would be an unprecedented forum forevaluating what we have done on the road to these reformsand for reiterating our tremendous faith and trust in thefuture of the generations of the twentyfirst century at this fiftysecond session of the general assemblywe are faced with the historic responsibility of givinggreater reality to our hopes and expectations for a betterfuture for humankind  the changes in those realities aretaking place faster than the changes in the structures wehave given ourselves for dealing with them  we have aunique opportunity to ensure that the reforms of theorganization respond to the expectations of a unitednations that is in line with the needs of the new age  i should like first to express my personal satisfaction and that of my delegation at the unanimous election of mr  belaúnde as president of this session of the general assembly  his election not only recognizes his personal influence, which has been felt in the united nations ever since it was founded at san francisco, but is also welldeserved tribute to his country, which has contributed so greatly to the development of international law and culture in america and as such is a source of profound satisfaction to all the latin american countries  our ideals of peace and justice in international relations have found in mr  belaúnde, with his brilliant intelligence, his scholarship, backed by solid religious and moral convictions and his moving eloquence, an outstanding champion in each of the phases in the history of our organization which he so admirably described in his speech of acceptance [h meeting]  may i add my good wishes for the success of his work in the high office he now occupies once again the general assembly is meeting to review what has been achieved and to initiate new efforts in the cause of peace and collective security, the most serious and urgent problem of our time and the raison d’être of the united nations in its exposition of the function of the main organs and in guiding principles of the united nations, the charter clearly established what might be described as the factors of peace and international security  the pacific settlement of international disputes, the development of respect for the principle of equal rights and selfdetermination of peoples, the control and ultimate elimination of the armaments race, the solution of problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, the promotion of social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom — these are the conditions that must be satisfied if we are to attain the goals to which mankind’s hopes for peace and security are directed in the case of each of these conditions of peace and security, the means to be employed depend on the goal to be attained  in the case of some of them it is clear that the full exercise of the functions of the united nations organs is the only appropriate approach  but, although that approach might seem equally applicable to every question covered by the charter, there are some cases in which it would not attain the desired end  for example, in the case of matters that bear directly on the existence of a state, its political system and its social and economic organization, such efforts would fail and would moreover be contrary to the principle of the organization embodied in article  paragraph  of the charter  whatever the importance of the various items handed down to us from previous sessions of the assembly, including some of the questions most nearly affecting the cause of peace, such as disarmament, the development of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, it is evident that the arms race is an effect or a symptom rather than the cause of the tensions in international life today  in the opinion of my delegation and country international tension has its roots in the' fear and mistrust implanted in the minds of the free nations of the world by the onslaught of a militant and dogmatic ideology whose real danger lies not in its economic and social methods or its nihilistic attitude to certain spiritual values which we cannot renounce, but in its subversive tendencies, in its revolutionary and uncompromising solutions of political and social problems, insofar as it seeks to impose them on the rest of the world, and in the persistent threat it offers to the independence and sovereignty of states  international communism, by systematically extending its influence in a manner disturbing to the orderly progress of the international community, is the most important factor in the political tensions that divide the world into what have hitherto been two irreconcilable camps  it is this danger, this constant threat of aggression, that has given rise to the arms race, a psychology that makes the positions of the two sides mutually incomprehensible, and the allocation to national defence needs of resources that could be better employed in promoting the great economic, social, cultural and humanitarian aims of the united nations the government of the dominican, republic believes that it can best contribute to the cause of peace by strengthening its internal and external security, opposing any act of aggression, consolidating its traditional alliances with the great powers of the free world, and supporting the fundamental aims of the united nations, which constitute the best guarantee of the peaceful coexistence of all nations it has been frequently said that peace and international security are not a monopoly or exclusive responsibility of the great powers  certainly the smaller nations must not be content with playing the role of a greek chorus  if international public opinion is a factor of importance in international relations today, it is here in the general assembly of the united nations that it is acquiring growing powers of persuasion and greater influence over the destiny of the world it is in this assembly, where newly created nations come as sovereign states to solemnize, as it were, their new status, that we should vigorously and clearly proclaim our belief that the sovereignty and independence of states are sacrosanct and that only through respect for the dignity of these prerogatives can international cooperation and progress towards the ultimate goals of the united nations be achieved for all these reasons, the great problem which underlies the various items on our agenda, and which the great powers in particular will have to consider in exploring the possibilities of agreements to advance the cause of peace, is the creation of a climate of confidence and a real clarification of intentions and, objectives, going far beyond the mere dogmatic affirmations of a belief in peace not borne out by the facts, my delegation sincerely hopes that the exchanges of views which have taken place between two great powers in whose hands the fate of the world largely rests may prove successful and not be as fruitless as the socalled geneva spirit of some of the speakers who have preceded me at this rostrum have underlined the importance of the observance by all states of the principle of freedom of communication  may i say that my country fully shares that concern  if there is one field in which our interdependence as nations is abundantly clear, it is in the field of communications, which, of course, include maritime as well as aerial, radio and telephone communications it has been said that any material or intellectual interchange between states and the inhabitants of states presupposes means of communication  the right of communication is therefore from the sociological point of view the sine qua non of international life  such is the importance of communications in the life of the international community that any measure to restrict or suspend them by the individual and arbitrary decision of a state is an act of such gravity that it might be considered a violation of article  paragraph  of the charter of the united nations, since such action is an enforcement measure that can only be validly taken by the competent organs of the international community, such as the security council of the united nations under article of the charter the cooperation of the dominican republic with the united nations is expressed in our direct collaboration with the organization and with those regional and specialized agencies of which we are a member, as well as in our national policy  the policy of the dominican republic is based on the conviction that the united nations constitutes an indispensable instrument in the evolution of international relations towards the establishment of a truly international society  relations between states in the world today would be inconceivable without a universal organization of the scope of the united nations  if it did not exist it would have to be created  its existence at the present time constitutes one of the best guarantees for the rational conduct of international affairs my government is deeply interested in all efforts at the international level to ensure the most effective possible implementation of collective security; it has supported the united nations emergency force and has contributed its proportional share towards the maintenance of that force since  i am happy to state that it will continue this policy and will support at the present session any measure that will ensure the effectiveness of this important instrument for the maintenance of peace and collective security the dominican republic has also made substantial contributions to other united nations activities directed to urgent humanitarian ends, and has for example contributed a total sum of $for the assistance of refugees, through the various agencies concerned, first the intergovernmental committee on refugees, later the international refugee organization and more recently the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees and the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east our participation in unicef dates back to the establishment of that great instrument for humanitarian action, to which we have made contributions totalling $ and last month we contributed a further $for the continued support of its programmes we have also maintained regular and substantial participation in the technical assistance programme of the united nations one of the most striking features of the present century in international relations has been the emergence of new states in the international community and in the united nations  my government and country are not indifferent to the movement which in asia and africa is initiating a process similar to that which in the nineteenth century culminated in the emergence of the american states as part of the international community  this process is giving effect to one of the highest goals of the united nations, and my government, which endeavours to establish friendly relations with countries where this national consciousness is awakening — as was shown by the recent exchange of visits of high officials of the government of the dominican republic and of the republic of liberia — views such aspirations with sympathy, while maintaining at all times the balanced and conciliatory stand it has always taken in the discussion of questions concerning the transition from a nonselfgovernment or international trusteeship to statehood and independence i should like to refer now to another aspect of the dominican government’s policy of cooperation with the united nations, that of this polity’s repercussions at the national level  the charter recognizes in article  paragraph  that one of the organization’s purposes is to serve as a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends, and it follows that efforts must be made first of all within the nations themselves to attain the principal objectives of the united nations and particularly those relating to economic, social and cultural development and the protection of human rights and of fundamental freedoms for all without distinction of race, sex, language or religion  this individual role of each state in furthering united nations purposes is laid down in article  which forms part of one of the most remarkable chapters of the united nations charter — chapter ix, relating to international economic and social cooperation — and which makes clear the obligation of all member states to take both joint and separate action to achieve the objectives set forth in that chapter there exists a line of propaganda, based on deliberate and crass ignorance of presentday conditions in the dominican republic, which maliciously, represents my country’s government as violating basic constitutional standards with regard to human rights  according to this same propaganda we ought also to apologize for the length of time the political party which guides the destinies of the dominican republic has been in power  the reproach would certainly be justified if it could be shown that the period of nearly three decades in which that party has been in power was a period in which the dominican nation had made no progress, a period of regression, backwardness and decadence in the life of the dominican people  we realize that every government is born with its historical responsibilities and that it is precisely the regime whose actions are inspired by its consciousness of those responsibilities which will endure, for in political affairs no form of government can be maintained in a vacuum or can prosper in negation or if it is incapable of fulfilling its people’s desires and demands what is certain is that during the first decades of this century it became obvious that we in the dominican republic had to overcome the economic, social and cultural prostration caused by our troubled history and that a programme of national recuperation must be heroically undertaken and implemented  until  our history was shaped by the incongruity between the principles set forth in our constitutional charter and the reality of underlying economic and social conditions  with the extent of our national territory undetermined because of centurylong failure to solve the boundary problem, with the collapse of our financial structure and the ensuing bankruptcy and compromising of our national sovereignty, with our population decimated by endemic diseases which undermined its productive capacity, sunk in the depths of ignorance and existing precariously in a primitive economy, the dominican nation had to face a battle with lost time which required an intense effort of political unity in order to ensure the fullest participation of all dominicans in the fight for riches, wellbeing and progress it is obvious that under those conditions we could hardly be a factor of international cooperation  in  our territorial boundaries were fixed by the additional boundary protocol, supplemented by our policy of dominicanization of the frontier; and in  at a time when we were compelled to incur considerable expenditures for defence in order to confront a subversive coalition, we completely redeemed the dominican international debt with the payment of $ economic, social and cultural indexes register the progressive development achieved by successive administrations under the same unified political direction — and the following positive results have been achieved as economic matters have acquired greater importance in the deliberations of the major interamerican conferences, one of the problems which has rightly been considered as fundamental  in any scientific economic planning is the problem of land tenure  in more than one latin american country, agrarian reform is one of the highest aspirations of social progress  if the dominican republic has today succeeded in multiplying the national budget of about $million by fifteen and the indexes of dominican per caput income by a similar amount, it may be affirmed that this state of affairs is the result of vast agrarian reforms achieved in our country by means of a series of measures beginning with the parcelling of the land, the distribution of seeds and farm equipment, vocational schools, rural medical care, construction of irrigation canals representing an investment of more than $million and kilometres long with an irrigable capacity of more than “tareas”, that is, about hectares, experimental farming stations, the construction of communications, and, lastly, the establishment of banking institutions specialized in financing agricultural and industrial undertakings  land distribution statistics show that between  when the dominican agrarian reform programme was begun, and  more than million tareas” were distributed among farmers  the results of this agrarian reform can be better appreciated when it is considered that the annual production of the agricultural groups which before was only worth $ in the last sevenyear period reached $million, to the exclusive benefit of the farmers, who in obtained exclusive ownership of their lands in accordance with act no   dated june of that year in order to give a rough idea of the stage reached by dominican education in recent times, it is sufficient to point out that, while our population has doubled in the last twentytwo years, primary school facilities during the same period have been increased elevenfold  there are pupils registered in country and city schools, teenagers attending secondary schools and being trained in vocational schools  the university of santo domingo, whose glorious tradition dates back to  the year of its foundation, and which played so outstanding a role during the american colonial era, has today a registration of more than pupils and has seven faculties and five specialized institutes or schools  the culmination of this effort is the trujillo campaign for total literacy, the effectiveness of which is demonstrated by the fact that, although the illiteracy index in was per cent, it has today been reduced to per cent  that is why mr  r  barón castro at the third iberoamerican congress on education, held at ciudad trujillo in october and november  stated on behalf of the executive board of unesco that illiteracy in the dominican republic had decreased sharply as regards health and social security, there are over hospitals, maternity homes, sanatoria, and private clinics in all parts of the republic  there are thirtytwo dietetic and child nutrition establishments, and savings institutions and educational cooperatives have been organized in eighty establishments the dominican policy as regards human rights has been implemented through a body of laws and institutions which achieved their highest expression in the dominican constitutional reform of  whereby the state’s principal aim was recognized as being the effective protection of human rights and the establishment and maintenance of means which would enable human beings to make steady progress within a framework of freedom and social justice compatible with public order, the general welfare and universal rights, this fundamental principle has been supplemented by the new concept of a modern constitutional system represented by the provisions on economic and social rights which are contained in one of the covenants on human rights being prepared by the commission on human rights and which have been embodied in the present dominican constitution in the introduction to his annual report on the  work of the organization, the secretarygeneral refers to the activities envisaged by the united nations charter which, although not carried out directly by united nations organs, are nevertheless linked by the charter to the tasks of our organization  with reference to the recommendations made in article  regarding the security council, that the council should take into account any procedure which the parties may have adopted in order to settle a dispute, he expresses the opinion that this rule has been understood to have reference especially to efforts on a regional basis or through regional organizations like the organisation of american states [a/add  p  ,the dominican delegation considers that the regional organizations, far from detracting from the importance and predominance of the united nations in the sphere of international relations, are in a position to carry out a complementary mission of the greatest importance since, with the continual advent of new sovereign and independent entities in international life, new regional communities of states are being formed and the world organization volume of work is increasing the government of the dominican republic has always pursued a policy of peace in its international relations, particularly with those countries with which it is geographically and historically linked  a striking demonstration of that policy was the solution of the centurylong boundary dispute with its neighbour, the republic of haiti, by the signature of the additional boundary protocol of  the dominican republic peaceful disposition is also evidenced by its ratification of all the legal instruments on the maintenance of peace in america, among them the most perfect of all, the american treaty on pacific settlements, signed at bogota in which makes the fullest provision for the settlement of international disputes by legal procedures the dominican government has always been very respectful of whatever measures for the peaceful settlement of international disputes have been proposed to it  although a zealous defender of the sovereignty for which it has had to fight so hard, it is also respectful of the sovereignty of others  hence we must place on record our categorical rejection of the allegations made in a statement by the minister of foreign affairs off the republic of cuba that the dominican republic is a centre of revolutionary operations against the cuban regime  the events responsible for the international tensions in the caribbean are too recent for anyone to try to startle this plenary meeting with accusations which only rebound against their authors  it was, in fact, from cuban territory that the aggressive expedition which arrived in the dominican republic on and june set out with the purpose of unleashing a civil war, but they were completely annihilated by the dominican armed forces with the effective cooperation of the rural population — an unequivocal demonstration of the essential popularity of dominican political institutions after this involuntary digression, i should like to refer to an event destined to exercise a major influence on the development of interamerican relations  operation panamerica, justly praised by those representatives of american nations who have spoken before me, is in the tradition of americanism with which brazilian diplomacy is identified  although it expresses the interests and aspirations of the latin american half of the american partnership, the reception given by the united states government to the initiative of the president of brazil, mr  kubitschek, is also worthy of high praise  i had occasion to emphasize the importance of this initiative in the assembly at its thirteenth session {t meeting}, on the eve of the informal meeting of foreign ministers at washington, at which a new interamerican economic policy was devised  the most practical achievement of which has been the setting up of the interamerican development bank for the purpose of stimulating economic development in latin america  the significance of operation panamerica is that continental solidarity is one and indivisible like its destiny  it means, in accordance with the guiding principle of the diplomacy which gave it birth, that american relations must be adjusted in action and spirit to form a perfect unity conceived on the basis of mutual respect among all the states of the american community  it means that any idea of antagonistic blocs or of exclusive groups is contrary to the best interests of a united america  it implies lastly that, without economic and social solidarity, american solidarity wot\\\\|d break down in an atmosphere of disagreement and discouragement likely to stimulate those influences which seek to draw the american economy into the orbit of a policy based on the principles of dialectical materialism and class struggle transferred into the field of international relations  the dire consequences of such an orientation are easily foreseeable  because we share the conviction of those who believe that the historical community of america has a wealth of spiritual and material resources to develop, in the spirit of our traditions, which are based on western christian thought, the most outstanding example of regional international cooperation in the spirit of chapter dc of the charter, the dominican delegation would like to congratulate the government of brazil on its magnificent contribution to the cause of american unity the dominican delegation hopes most sincerely that this session of the assembly, continuing in the significant tradition of previous sessions — so well embodied in our president, mr  belaúnde — will prove worthy of the hopes of mankind and of the noble leadership which he has demonstrated in the united nations, so that the fourteenth session of the assembly will go down in history as the harbinger of peace and conciliation  it is a pleasure for my delegation, mr  president, to offer you its congratulations on the honour which the assembly has conferred on you and your country by appointing you to preside over the work of the present session  the experience you have demonstrated in similar capacities in other united nations organs and in other posts, and your ability, prudence and other qualities are undoubtedly an assurance of success in your present duties my delegation is also happy to welcome to this organization the new states of malawi, malta and zambia, which have come to take on and to share the heavy responsibilities imposed on all members of the united nations by its charter  the admission of these members to the organization is a further step on the way to decolonization, and the fact that when the charter was signed in there were fiftyone members, whereas today the original number has more than doubled, with african nations predominating among the new members, shows how much progress has been made the remarks of the dominican republic on this occasion and at this stage of the general debate will, in view of the present circumstances, necessarily be very brief and be confined to some aspects of the problems which most directly concern it within the framework of the united nations  before taking these up, however, we must express our hope and earnest wish that the difficulties  which the organization is now facing may be dealt with in a realistic spirit and be satisfactorily overcome, so that its existence and authority may be reaffirmed and it may carry out the task assigned to it in the preamble of the charter, for the good of mankind  it is hardly necessary for me to say that the united nations must be preserved at all costs and regardless of the sacrifices involved and that we must all do our utmost to preserve it, since it is our common heritage built up over the centuries in an endeavour to find a formula enabling people to live together in peace and understanding  now that the formula has been found, we must take advantage of it and prevent it from being thwarted the dominican republic is doing everything in its power to give its people, abandoned for many years to a harsh fate, an awareness of the freedom they had been denied and the means to overcome the economic atrophy which was their lot for more than three decades and has been aggravated by the world situation of today  the progress, as yet rudimentary, already achieved has been due to the goodwill and patriotism of their present leaders and to the initiative of the dominican people themselves, also, in a particular way, to cooperation from outside sources, among which the technical assistance agencies of the united nations and’ the alliance for progress have played a large part  by its own efforts and with the assistance which it hopes it will continue to receive, the dominican republic will inevitably overcome its economic difficulties both for its own benefit and for the sake of other areas in the same region which, lacking adequate natural resources, cannot but profit from any progress made by the dominican republic one of the most serious problems that is already having an alarmingly apparent impact on the country economic and social wellbeing and is aggravating its underdevelopment is population growth, which, although a matter of concern in latin america as well as elsewhere, is assuming unusual features in the dominican republic  even today the dominican economy produces barely enough food to supply a population of about million, which, within the short space of no more than twenty years, will be doubled  the prediction of malthus, with all its attendant calamities, is being fulfilled in the dominican republic, for while the population appears to be increasing in rapid geometrical progression, the same is not true of the means of subsistence, which appear to have remained stationary or, at best, to be increasing in arithmetical progression  the consequences which such a situation portends are easy to imagine this grave problem, the dimensions of which were pointed out by secretarygeneral thant in his report to this assembly [a/, has been tackled by the dominican government, which intends to solve it not merely by resorting to mechanical or artificial processes of doubtful applicability and efficacy but by employing scientific methods of positive economic value  accordingly, the dominican government, with the help of united nations technical assistance in conjunction with the facilities of the alliance for progress, is at present studying a programme for developing the basins of two of the largest rivers in the republic  the waters of these rivers will be used to irrigate what is virtually barren land and convert it into a vast source of agricultural products and to produce hydroelectric power so that not only will the present and future food problem be solved, but the general economic progress of the country will be furthered through a rise in per capita income far beyond present or prospective levels  this project, as is obvious, is directly related to the united nations development decade against this background, the dominican republic reaffirms its decision to support all the measures proposed on the occasion of the united nations conference on trade and development, held at geneva from march to june  and will do everything in its power to ensure their complete and prompt implementation  the application of some of these measures will make a direct contribution to solving the economic problems of the dominican republic as well as of other developing countries  such measures will call for discarding habits of long standing, and this will mean sacrifices which the dominican people, let it be said in their favour, are prepared to accept in the hope of achieving a better standard of living and of removing the internal tensions which poverty and social injustice inevitably create,a good omen of the success of the measures suggested or proposed at geneva is the solidarity of the developing countries as reflected in the group of seventyseven, which, let it be said in passing, must, in its membership or composition, be based on the principle of complete universality or be a union of all the poorer countries having the same objective of achieving better economic conditions with regard to strictly internal matters, the present government has undertaken to maintain order and the institutions of the republic in the service of the people and to protect fundamental freedoms  freedom of the press and all other human rights are enjoyed by all the dominican people, who will have the opportunity next september of going to the polls in order to legitimize their country constitutional status by installing in office a freely elected democratic government with regard to the purely international order, my government reiterates and reaffirms its traditional policy of respect for international obligations and zeal for peace  it therefore confirms its adherence to the principles and standards of the united nations charter in their full scope and breadth and to the agreements, norms, decisions and opinions emanating from its organs, in particular from the international court of justice  my delegation is accordingly in a position to announce that the dominican government will ratify general assembly resolutions a and b (xvui), which make provision for the enlargement of the security council and the economic and social council  it will also maintain its declared position with regard to the republic of china and will therefore reaffirm that country right to occupy the place which properly belongs to it in the organization with regard to the problem of disarmament and related problems, the problem of selfdetermination and its corollary, decolonization, and the problem of apartheid and all forms of discrimination, my government strongly reaffirms its determination to cooperate in the removal of the conditions which give rise to such problems the desire of all peoples to live in peace is particularly noticeable in the developing countries, because without peace their striving for economic progress will be blocked  peace, however, presupposes a juridical order of respect for the norms established and created by law  within the international community such a juridical order is ensured by the principles embodied in the charter of the united nations  without the united nations the world would inevitably revert to an era of temporizing between the great powers and the states dependent on them, that is to say, to a situation containing the seeds of war  in order to prevent ourselves from falling into such a state of affairs, which would be fatal for the smaller states, we must ensure that the united nations continues in existence and preserves its prestige and effectiveness we therefore believe that an opportunity to make these principles and ideas live, to restore their full force and to propagate them among all the nations of the world is being offered to us in this year, which has been designated international cooperation year [see resolution (xviii), a year in which the activities of all the countries represented in this assembly should and must be inspired by a desire to reduce tension by halting the arms race, by continuing the dialogue between the industrialized and the developing powers, by eliminating colonialism and discriminatory policies and by determining to resolve disputes between nations by peaceful means  in response to the unanimous sentiments of the people of the dominican republic, my government comes for the seventh time to this general assembly in order to give further evidence of its firm resolve to contribute unwaveringly and unconditionally by every means at its disposal to the efforts made by the united nations in the difficult task of attempting through conciliation and agreement to find a just solution of the many problems and disputes that have been submitted to it for consideration and decision  these problems and disputes reflect the most varied aspects of the serious social and political crisis through which our generation is passing m these difficult times, and they confront the world with the terrible threat of war and destruction  our participation in the noble work of the general assembly is based, as always, upon an imperative desire for international cooperation  that we are able to realize that desire is the result of one of the most outstanding victories of contemporary civilization in the field of international law, namely, the final and complete recognition of the equal sovereignty of states, irrespective of their military strength or the extent of their territories we in the dominican republic are convinced that this fundamental principle of equality, which unites in this assembly the community of the nations of the world on the basis of their common right to participate in the examination and discussion of problems and points of disagreement and, consequently, in the taking of decision designed to settle such matters, can and should be a sufficient stimulus to the creation and strengthening of an unshakeable faith that this eminent body can ensure a progressive implementation of the principles of international law and the supremacy of justice which will eventually make it possible for confidence and mutual respect to prevail in relations between states  this is the only way which will assuredly lead to the foundation of the hopedfor world of peace in which all peoples have equal rights to pursue their respective destinies in fitting conditions of wellbeing, their spiritual expansion unhampered in this urgent task of achieving international peace and security, it is the general assembly which, by a kind of positive and praiseworthy development, has become the leading organ of the united nations  because the assembly is indisputably competent to deal with the essential problems of the maintenance of peace and to seek practical formulae for the cooperation of states in economic and social matters, the assembly is in itself the strongest guarantee of the effectiveness and permanence of the united nations when it made a careful and patient examination of the long list of items on the agenda of the present session, my government, like that of all nations which love peace and order, was never for a moment unaware of the almost insurmountable difficulty inevitable and relentlessly arising in connexion with every problem before the general assembly, due to the continued misunderstanding of certain governments whose selfish interests, sharpened by ideological zeal, lead them to reduce all their arguments to vituperation and slander and whose totally intransigent attitude in most cases frustrates or disappoints the most legitimate hopes for a speedy settlement of disputes and the successful outcome of that high endeavour which it is the duty of the united nations to make in order to lead the peoples of the world towards true progress thus, the course of the very serious events in korea, the questions of tunisia and morocco, the restoration of austrian sovereignty and independence, the repatriation of gr eek children, the international regulation of armed forces and armaments, collective measures to ensure peace and security, and, finally, the question of the admission of new members — to mention but a few of the items for our consideration — are all questions which, given present political circumstances and independently of their own characteristics and peculiarities, are unfortunately and inevitably dominated by considerations which are/ strictly speaking, alien to them and which can in no way contribute to a correct assessment of their elements, in accordance with a true and unrestricted adherence to the purposes and principles freely and unanimously adopted at san francisco the delegation of the dominican republic will, as it has always done, support the efforts of those who understand and admit that, whatever the obstacles, the general assembly, in response to the urgent appeal of international public opinion, must fulfil the high purposes which explain and justify the existence of our organization, my delegation will unhesitatingly approve all solutions which, while ensuring respect for and proper application of the basic principles of international law, particularly those principles set forth and enshrined in the letter and spirit of the charter, ensure also, in accordance with the relevant provisions, both the inviolability of the domestic jurisdiction of states and the faithful observance of international obligations voluntarily assumed   i shall take this opportunity to reiterate our conviction that if we could succeed in achieving unity of mind and effort with regard to methods of collective action which might be used to maintain and strengthen international peace and security, all, or nearly all, the political problems before the general assembly might, solely by virtue of that important agreement, find, speedy and appropriate solutions likewise, on the question of the admission of new members, we wish to reaffirm our belief in the universality of the united nations  an obvious paradox arises whenever there is a refusal to admit peaceloving peoples who respect the principles of the charter; such exclusion limits the scope — which is necessarily universal — of our charter, to the detriment of the peoples so arbitrarily deprived of the benefits of the cooperative action which is proceeding with increasing effectiveness within our organization in the same way, we naturally give our full attention to economic and social matters  these have greater possibilities than political matters, and there is no doubt that they offer more encouragement to hope and to believe in a reconciliation of views leading to the restoration of tranquility and the final achievement of peace  in this connexion, it would be no exaggeration to state that if we can find some positive means to promote the real development of economically underdeveloped nations, we shall have taken an enormous step forward towards the fulfilment and realization of the high purposes of the international community  that is our main reason for approving any proposal which, like the proposal for the establishment of an international finance corporation [e/ now under preparation by the international bank for reconstruction and development, is designed to settle the most urgent needs for capital, which is often difficult to obtain in the open money market, the object being to promote the healthy economic expansion of the underdeveloped countries by rendering possible the establishment and consolidation of undertakings which will ensure a substantial increase in their productivity given the increasing interdependence of the different parts of the contemporary world, all questions directly related to the international circulation and distribution of wealth, and in particular to the equitable distribution of exportable products from the countries in process of development, are just as important as the question of increasing the productive capacity which is required to ensure the economic development of nations which have hitherto been less favoured — a most urgent task, this will explain the support which we are prepared to give to any step which, in connexion with item of the agenda, referring to the economic development of underdeveloped countries or with any of the items considered annually by the second committee, would lead to the inclusion, as a permanent item, in the agenda of the general assembly of a periodic study of problems specifically arising from the expansion of international trade  that would enable the general assembly, as the supreme executive organ of the united nations, to outline or help to outline the overriding principles which should serve as a basis for international policy in this matter, reconciling the difficulties arising from a lack of flexibility in the import markets of the industrialized countries with the legitimate concern of growing nations that their exportable products should be  properly absorbed by those markets  by this means, the general assembly and the competent organs of the united nations would be able to open up impressive opportunities for the development of trade, and accordingly for a rapid rise in the standard of living of all the peoples of the world, disposing of the problems and the risks at present involved in the fair distribution of resources and exportable surpluses, such problems being an obvious impediment to the progress of nations which are endeavouring to reach economic maturity and an open insult to the peoples who are directly contributing to the creation of wealth by their efforts and sacrifices in the honourable tradition of american international legal thought, we may, as a justification for our proposals, refer to our profound devotion to the principle which has long prevailed in interamerican affairs, that the economic security indispensable for the progress of all peoples is at any time the best guarantee of their political security and of the success of their joint efforts for the maintenance of peace  no other convictions but these have inspired and continue to inspire the government of the dominican republic in planning and embarking on the implementation of one of the most outstanding and complete programmes of economic rehabilitation ever attempted in latin america  allow me to say, with proper patriotic pride, that it has also been one of the most fruitful and most productive of benefits for our people the policy of agrarian reform and industrialization which my government is pursuing, with the intention of progressively meeting the needs of our people while enabling them to purchase a greater quantity of the foreign products that are required to expand our production and raise our levels of consumption, is an immense effort which can achieve its maximum results only if the laws of economic interdependence are observed and if international cooperation is practised on a basis of equality  as in the case of any country in process of development, our productive capacity might be seriously hampered and even paralysed if we were unable at the same time to rely on a speedy and substantial demand from world markets in a position to absorb our exports and thereby to secure our purchasing power and means of exchange,i have referred only to my country experience as an example, although i am sure that other nations which, like it, are passing through the same stages of economic development, share its needs and concerns, and i feel that these needs are sufficient to justify our plea that the united nations should devote its unswerving attention to this most important aspect of cooperation and solidarity among peoples we are prepared, as always, to offer the united nations any contribution which we may be able to make on the basis of the technical experience and knowledge we have acquired concerning the various matters related to the process of the economic development of nations  we attach particular importance to the valuable efforts contributed by the economic and social council, of which my country hopes shortly to become a member, and we trust that our application for admission will be favourably received in  we cherish this hope because we understand that active participation in the work of such an important united nations organ must be of the greatest benefit, by reason of the high quality of the study and research which that organ carries out in the economic and social fields, in which my government is especially interested and in which it has already achieved so much at the national level furthermore, can say that our country attaches equal importance, as we have previously stated, to the social questions under consideration at this session] among these i would mention, together with questions which are just as important, the question of international respect for the right of peoples to selfdetermination and the recognition of political rights for women  we shall naturally collaborate with the utmost goodwill and determination in securing both those rights in view of the high honour conferred upon the dominican republic when it was chosen some years ago as a nonadministering member of the trusteeship council, we are anxious to contribute from the technical experience acquired by us in this field to all subjects to be examined by the general assembly in connexion with the application of the international trusteeship system, and we are prepared to give our unreserved support to any steps which may contribute effectively to the promotion of the political, economic, social and educational progress of the inhabitants of the trust territories and thus ensure that those peoples may proceed without hindrance along the path towards selfgovernment or independence the questions before the sixth committee are of equal concern to us  amongst them those concerning the establishment of an international criminal jurisdiction and the definition of aggression are of particular importance  as regards the plan for an international criminal court, we think that it would be necessary to settle satisfactorily certain major difficulties which might arise in connexion with the prerogatives and fundamental rights of states, before taking a final decision on the practicability of such a grandiose project  as to the definition of aggression, we must stress its importance not only as one of the supreme requirements of collective security, but also as an essential preliminary to the effective establishment of an international criminal jurisdiction the government of the dominican republic takes this opportunity solemnly to reaffirm its unconditional adherence to and its full acceptance of the purposes and principles upon which the united nations chatter is based  my government is anxious to make this act of faith before the general assembly as an expression of its hope that the insecurity and disagreement prevailing at this moment in the work of our organization may speedily give place to a vigorous and close collaboration among the peoples and states exercising political dominion over the world, to the end that a firmly established feeling of good neighbourliness, that quality of which we are so proud in interamerican relations, may prevail ever more forcefully and effectively within the united nations discarding the negative attitudes of scepticism and impatience, we are so optimistic as to pin our faith to devotion to the higher values of the spirit and the indestructible empire of law, justice and freedom  thus inspired, we are taking part in these debates, as at all previous sessions, in the same spirit of collaboration, with the abiding purpose of assisting the great powers to find honourable means of conciliation and understanding ; with the same faith in the power of our organization to ensure amongst all nations the inevitable triumph of the rule of law; and with the same hope that we are now witnessing the dawn of international peace in which man, who is struggling towards perfection, may find an appropriate environment for the full realization of his high destiny and the final achievement of the universal aspiration of brotherhood and progress   my delegation wishes to offer the president the congratulations due to him on his election to preside over the work of this general assembly, for we are encouraged by the hope that the work that awaits us on the proposed agenda will be carried out in the favourable atmosphere engendered by the goodwill of all of us who bear the grave responsibilities we assumed under the united nations charter  his election is a guarantee that this will be so, despite the magnitude of the task and the obstacles that will stand in the way of our efforts to find viable solutions to the problems on our agenda that will satisfy all the interests concerned and the aspirations that we all share  under your skilful direction we must hope that all the difficulties, disagreements and misunderstandings that may arise during this session that is just starting will be helped by the moderating spirit and the harmonious goodwill that prevailed at the birth of our organization at san francisco  the united nations gained maturity after being subjected to the most cruel tests, which, far from having weakened its power as the chief instrument for saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war, have enabled it to rise afresh each time with the necessary vitality to safeguard and to proclaim with authority the pronouncements in the preamble and the guiding principles enshrined in the charter  at the last session of the general assembly, the delegation of the dominican republic appeared for the first time as the genuine representatives of a democratic state ruled by a constitutional government elected by universal suffrage, after the vicissitudes that the principles on which the republic had been based in had suffered for many years  the government which i have the honour to represent at this rostrum not only bases its desires for justice and progress on the will of the people to survive and to work out an effective democracy on the lines of that defined in the charter of santiago de chile, but also to give unlimited respect to the legal order of the united nations and to the rights inherent in man, which are the guarantee of the human species  at the end of a year of that profession of faith, my delegation is glad to affirm that today the dominican republic is a state based on law and its democratic institutions are guaranteed by a constitution that has satisfied the social, political and economic demands of the dominican people, despite the economic and financial collapse from which the country was suffering when the constitutional period of government started on july  as a result of a prolonged political crisis and the ravages of the civil war  the progress made by the dominican republic during the constitutional period of government under the leadership of mr  joaquin balaguerhas fully justified the confidence of the people, who voted overwhelmingly in favour of it  their vote confirmed the determination of the people to live under the protection of a democratic régime that was able to establish the rule of justice, internal public confidence and international prestige, after the disruption brought about by the serious events that had disturbed the institutional life of the republic for years, when the armed and civil rebellions, facilitated by the previous armed conflict, had not yet been put down and the majority of the population had an alarming quantity of destructive weapons at their disposal and veritable arsenals were concealed in various parts of the country  it must be recognized that while, on the one hand, the task to be carried out called for a bloodless campaign for this type of disarmament, on the other hand there was a need for spiritual disarmament to overcome the danger and obstacles in the way of restoring to all minds the good sense and wisdom that had perished under the impetus of a state of disorder, pitilessly directed, that had taken possession of the will and patriotic sentiments that have been the outstanding characteristics of a people enamoured of freedom and independence  at the present time the country has made great progress towards the reconciliation and pacification of the communities, profoundly divided by political rancour which a disrupted economy has made worse and worse, bringing the disorder to a state not unlike that of the disasters that shatter the normal life of peoples  i would not be sincere in making this statement if i did not acknowledge that the country is still faced with some difficulties, which must be recognized as the remnants of the process of general disruption and of a real state of war with all the evils that such situations generate  these difficulties naturally affect the government plans for the total restoration of the national economy and of the results that are to be expected of the finances of a progressive state, where the juridical and administrative authorities are doing their utmost to overcome one of the most disturbed periods in the history of the country  in spite of these reservations, which i feel obliged to make, i must state here that the general dominican situation already allows us to hope for the progressive recovery of all the factors that are essential for the restoration of the economic order and the rationalization of financial stability  while we are still convalescing from many of the merciless evils that endangered democratic principles in the national territory, i can affirm that the necessary safeguards for the investment of national and foreign capital have been strengthened and public and private initiative has been encouraged by appropriate modern means, for the mobilization of all the productive forces of the country in order to rescue the copious natural resources that can stimulate those investments and the boundless wealth of possibilities that the country offers from the stagnation that had overtaken them  thus we hope to overcome, in a short space of time, the inertia that has been the actual cause of the delay in making progress in a medium that is so propitious for the achievement of the techniques recommended to the less developed countries  in order to give the development plans a more dynamic character, the public administration has made a great effort to give undiscriminating assistance for the development of diversified agriculture; it has managed to inspire confidence in stock breeding activities, which could rise to much higher levels from which the producers could profit in foreign markets; it has improved the deficit situation of the sugar industry in the dependent zones of the state  in that last respect, the increase in the quota assigned to the dominican republic in the united states market, after negotiations which were welcomed in the competent official centres, offers new prospects, not only in regard to the economic yield itself but also to the acquisition of the currency needed to give a more ambitious direction to the economic and financial system, whose scientific machinery is already operating, governed by the most advanced methods adapted to the modalities, possibilities and demands of the medium for which these instruments of economic progress in our time are designed  in the government programmes, which cover all promising fields, electrification is also being considered as a means of ensuring the constant expansion of industry, better conditions of economic life through the reduction of unemployment to a minimum and better paid use of labour  these programmes, which are now in full operation, include a considerable number of public works of every kind and provide for immediate and direct action by the government to carry out the largescale building activities that are needed to solve, as far as possible, the disturbing problem of housing  the development plans, whose scope i need not enlarge upon in this sketch of the dominican situation, are also designed to provide greater guarantees and facilities for trade expansion and, in particular, to secure foreign markets for the national products and to stimulate an immediate and rapid increase in those productive activities  it is for this reason that the dominican republic supports the principles and resolutions concerning latin american economic integration, which culminated in the meeting of american chiefs of state at punta del este and, more recently, the session held at asuncion, paraguay, at the ministerial level, which was an essential step for the adoption of the latin american common market within the prescribed time  all these projects, some of which are already in operation, have been and will be possible in my delegation country because of the government policy of arming all men with goodwill and initiative and freeing the minds of the people of the passions that have so deplorably divided the dominican family  the administration is indeed convinced that the destiny of the country depends on the pacification of consciences and the passage from revolution, in the way in which it was suffered by the people, to a true revolution of the people, consisting of progress and the uniting of all dominicans to channel the immutable attributes of the republic towards a new destiny of civilization and general wellbeing  lastly, i must acknowledge that the technical assistance we have received from the united nations, the economic and technical assistance of the organization of american states and the economic impetus that the alliance for progress has been providing through that organization, in accordance with the principles adopted at the punta del este meeting which gave rise to the alliance, have been of great help in the efforts undertaken by the dominican government and people to lift the country out of the unfavourable situation into which it had sunk  i thought it well, before speaking of the items on the agenda, to give a precise survey of the progress made by the dominican republic and i hope that in so doing i have confirmed the favourable predictions made by the dominican delegation at the twentyfirst session of the general assembly  it gives my delegation great pleasure to express its gratitude for the honour that has been conferred on it in being chosen as one of the vicepresidents of this assembly  this is undoubtedly a recognition of the efforts that my government is making to reaffirm the principles of effective democracy and to comply with the rules established by the charter, as well as reflecting proportional representation of the various geographical regions  the dominican republic reaffirms the sacred and inalienable right of selfdetermination of peoples  this principle brought about the separation of our people from the metropolitan country and the appearance of the republic in international life, influenced by the liberal ideas of the french revolution, the liberating ideals of simon bolivar and the declarations concerning determinant rights  armed with these firm convictions, we shall always support the immutable right of peoples to become free and independent states, wherever they may be and providing the desire for independence is an expression of the will of the dependent communities, whatever may be the size of the territory or the density of the population  we believe that our status as a state constituted in exercise of the right of selfdetermination, to which all peoples are entitled, does not allow us to disregard this principle or to remain indifferent to any weakening of it by the governing powers for reasons of selfinterest or policy  in  during the sixteenth session of the general assembly, the dominican delegation maintained that, if denuclearization was indivisible, then it should be recognized that latin america, as a region, had the right to adopt an individual denuclearization agreement  scarcely five years later, this view was shared by nearly all the latin american countries  this proposal for the banning of nuclear weapons, which was designed in this part of the hemisphere for the countries which not only realize that it is impossible for them to produce weapons of this destructive nature but are reluctant to weaken their economy still further when there are such urgent demands for material, social, political and cultural development, produced the essentially wise result of bringing about a collective will opposed to the introduction of weapons of mass destruction in this part of the world, in conflict with the inequality of defence of the powers involved in this matter  as a result of this state of mind, on february the latin american countries signed in mexico the treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons in latin america [see a/, which had come about as a result of the various sessions which had preceded the drafting and signature of this instrument  the dominican government decision to become a party to this important treaty does not in anyway interfere with any agreements on this serious problem which the nuclear powers may make among themselves  in keeping with the position that we have adopted on the question of general and complete disarmament, my country will continue its efforts to bring about the favourable atmosphere which may lead to the adoption, through the united nations, of an instrument giving effect to this noble aspiration  in accordance with our consistent devotion to the natural principle of the selfdetermination of peoples, my delegation is inclined prima facie to think that, at the right time and place, the people of korea should express their wishes through an electoral consultation, in a direct vote held on the basis of universal suffrage and guaranteed by the united nations  for this purpose it would be necessary to prepare a consultation based on the functions that have been entrusted to the united nations commission for the unification and rehabilitation of korea  my government doubts whether, in the state of affairs which large regions subject to the principles of the charter and to other advances of positive international law are experiencing, a step of such great implications could be taken in the near future  the problem calls for clear and precise replies to many unknown factors in order that the final decision on the subject, and its implementation, may not meet with other complications that might make it more difficult to put an end to a situation in which not only the powers concerned but all states members of the united nations are interested  whatever decision is taken on this important item of the agenda will have to conform to the requirements of the legal and peaceful settlement of disputes  whatever steps meets with general agreement, it will have to take into account all the previous happenings that led to the korean situation, with the important participation of the security council in the circumstances with which we are all familiar  whatever settlement is agreed upon, it will have to satisfy the need for effective and legitimate security measures calculated to maintain the status quo until such time as the final decisions are put into effect  with regard to the policy of the government of the republic of south africa, we have to admit that whatever proceedings may be contemplated must be in keeping with the declaration in paragraph of article of the charter, which lays down the purposes and principles of the united nations: to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion  this is clearly a provision that member states are called upon to fulfil, although the subject of human rights has become a glaring reality as the cause of international tensions which are liable to unleash the scourge of war, a result which all states which are subject to the regime of the world organization are in duty bound to avoid  this situation is one of great delicacy which requires to be handled with the greatest circumspection, in view of the fact that the principles of the charter oblige member states to refrain from intervening in the domestic affairs of other states, even if those members of the united nations are subjects of international law which are not contractually bound to the united nations  on this matter my government is of the opinion that, in view of the tensions to which we have referred, it would be wise not to prolong the sanctions which have been adopted beyond what is expedient and not to extend their field of application unduly  it is this thought that gives the dominican republic serious doubts with regard to rhodesia and south west africa  i must explain that my government regards these general considerations only as a basis for deductions which may meet with the approval of the states which are trying to find more perfect solutions  the dominican republic intends to take part in the second session of unctad, which is to be held at new delhi from february to march  taking a realistic view of our problems and with the desire to obtain the cooperation of the developed countries in confronting the delaying influence, a social evil which is just as complex as the evils of ignorance, destitution and poverty suffered by peoples  it is to be hoped that we shall have the same hope at new delhi that we had at geneva in  since that last session, there have been as many obstacles to the progress of the underdeveloped countries as there were before  when it is possible to appraise the practical results achieved, it will become clear that very little progress has been made towards the achievement of the objectives set forth in the geneva final act, in this connexion special mention should be made of the deterioration in the terms of trade brought about in the foreign trade of the countries which are struggling to achieve more satisfactory levels  i do not think there is any need for me to repeat here that we must always recognize that the development of our countries depends essentially on their exports  this is a problem inherent in development not only as a vital necessity for the peoples but even more as an imperative requirement for survival  thus the fall in the prices of many of our basic products to levels that are sometimes desperately low is a tragedy for us  nevertheless, we feel that in this age of burning realities we must not foster illusions that might lead to acts of unforeseeable consequences  the item concerning the world social situation is also of special interest to us  it is only by a thorough knowledge of the facts and of their different characteristics in the different regions that we can arrive at effective ways of finding specific and workable solutions in a field of such magnitude and such complexity  there is no denying that wars have their origin in the spirit of men and it is therefore in the spirit of men that the defences of peace must be conceived  the majority of countries in the world are confronting a crisis which is not only political and economic but also, and very emphatically, a crisis of understanding  it is clear from history that misunderstanding among the countries of the world has been the cause of the suspicion and mistrust that have dragged nations into the disagreements and frictions that cause war  we therefore feel that the item should be discussed on the basis of all the particular points that are likely to generate social phenomena and to bring the peoples nearer to the road that leads to their wellbeing, which in the last resort is the road of peace  we urge once again that the problem of vietnam should be solved on the basis of agreements satisfying the opposing interests and we recognize that the precedent established by the peaceful and democratic elections in which the people of vietnam had an opportunity to express their wishes freely through their votes is a sign that a legitimate right properly exercised can still meet the challenge of armed force  these results provide a fresh element on which to form the decision that must be taken on the request of the peaceloving peoples  lastly, we reiterate our confidence that the situation in the middle east can be settled through negotiations which respect the procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes  the blood of quijote flows in the veins of all us latin americans to a greater or lesser degree, and for that reason we are always ready to break lances in honour of the great lady called freedom, for it is only she who will produce the peace for which we long  we must be attached to peace and international brotherhood if we wish to survive  only through the widest cooperation among peoples, the sole means at our disposal, can we find a strong shield against the disasters of individual ambitions  our voice is the voice of the small nation that calls upon the great nations to reflect, so that they may fulfil their great destiny and their great duty  the voice of the weak, armed with law and justice, can be stronger than the voice of the strong, armed with their own political interest  we do not like to see the great nations using their power to trample on the small, nor do we like to see various nations aligned for the destruction of other nations or for destruction among themselves, a pragmatic conception of life teaches us that political inequality inevitably accompanies the juridical equality of states  these considerations bring to mind the unchanging dominican thesis, faithfully and brilliantly expressed by dr  americo lugo, our country great orator and internationalist, at the fourth american international conference, held at buenos aires in  for we have always pursued a great ideal, striving for it and ready to die for it if necessary  this great voice of a small nation at this big conference was praised by leopoldo lugones, the eminent argentine poet, who said: 'whether or not it is the voice of the weak, it is the most honourable and the noblest that has been heard at this conference  dr  americo lugo, criticizing the lack of a great ideal in the programme, said: the established nations which are prosperous and rich are looking for markets; but those that are not prosperous but are weak and poor are seeking peace, stability and freedom before markets  i do not believe in wealth — he added — but in virtue, ideals are more necessary than bread  to think one thing and to profess another dishonours diplomacy  sincerity is the chastity of nations  carlos mascari called lugo the valiant defender of the american ideal  let us hold fast to these ideas and follow this path  as far as we dominicans are concerned, that is our national and international line of conduct  \\ufeffon behalf of the government of the dominican republic and of the delegation which i have the honour of leading, i wish to convey to mr  lusaka our most sincere congratulations on his election to preside over the work of the thirtyninth session of the general assembly  this welldeserved distinction recognizes his role as a fighter for the cause of peace and the wellbeing of nations, his brilliant work as president of the united nations council for namibia and his effective cooperation in the united nations  his election augurs well for the balanced and fruitful conduct of this session  this wise choice is also an eloquent tribute to the country, zambia, and to the entire african continent, which is characterized by its devotion to the quest for a fairer international social order my delegation also pays a tribute to the outgoing president, mr  jorge illueca, for his efficient leadership of the deliberations of the general assembly at the thirtyeighth session  his diplomatic skill won him the admiration of all and is a source of pride to the peoples of latin america i should also like to express our gratitude to the secretarygeneral for his perseverance in translating into reality the purposes and principles of the charter of the united nations and for his invaluable contributions to the cause of progress and international peace and security allow me to extend a most cordial welcome to the new state of brunei darussalam, which recently won independence  its efforts to realize the ideals of justice pursued by the united nations will undoubtedly prove to be an asset to the organization the international situation, which grows more alarming each passing day, should be a matter of collective concern to all peaceloving nations and should, of necessity, lead them to strengthen the united nations  this firm belief inspires me to reiterate the idea i put forward in my statement at the thirtyeighth session that:at this difficult time in the history of mankind, international cooperation, which is an essential element for harmonious coexistence among nations, must be the force behind our actions if we are to overcome the present situation  in view of the growing interdependence that characterizes contemporary international relations, today problems affect all the members of the international community but have a greater impact on the least developed among them  we are therefore concerned at the tendency on the part of some industrialized states to abandon the necessary cooperation among states, which should be based on  a profound feeling of solidarity  we must create a real political will to embark upon genuine international cooperation, which should have as its aim the establishment of social justice among our peoples international life is dominated by the critical choice between war and peace  there is a close interdependence between two basic requirements for the growth and advancement of the developing countries: first, the creation of conditions of peace and security and, secondly, the launching of a new international economic order  the arms race militates at one and the same time against attaining both of these requirements the stalemate in the disarmament negotiations between the two superpowers has resulted in quantitative and qualitative arms escalation  the international tension created by that escalation is one of the principal obstacles to the attainment of those goals  moreover the resources that should be devoted to development are being used instead to produce more sophisticated armaments in this important matter, i wish to state that we associate ourselves fully with the joint declaration on peace and world disarmament made on may by the heads of state or government of argentina, greece, india, mexico, sweden and the united republic of tanzania  we agree with those illustrious statesmen that:the power and ingenuity of the human race must be used, not to perfect weapons of annihilation, but to harness the resources of the earth so that all people may enjoy a life of security and dignity in an international system free of war and based on peace and justice for the dominican republic, negotiation and dialogue are the best instruments in the search for peace  there is no dispute for which a fair solution cannot be found through the means of peaceful settlement provided by international law and the charter of the united nations itself  as a corollary to this deepfelt conviction, our government takes a consistent position of principle that of rejecting, in so far as international coexistence is concerned, any threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state keeping the peace should be an indivisible commitment for all members of the united nations  we applaud and encourage the work being done by the special committee on the charter of the united nations and on the strengthening of the role of the organization with a view to preventing international conflicts and diminishing the risk that they pose  my delegation values that work very highly and announces here its constant willingness to contribute to the attainment of those basic objectives at the past two sessions of the general assembly, i explained in detail that my country was desirous of and interested in cooperating in bringing about a negotiated settlement to the central american conflict  the government of the dominican republic has constantly echoed those responsible voices that offer assistance in restoring peace in those brother countries, free from outside impositions or interference, and in devoting their energies and resources to the requirements of development on his very first day in office, in august  the president of my country, mr  salvador jorge blanco, in the santo domingo declaration issued jointly with four other latin american leaders, recommended dialogue and negotiations as means for resolving the crisis in central america, along with other measures for bringing about political, social and economic recovery in the region the dominican republic has always expressed support for the steps taken by the contadora group, maintaining an unchanging and unequivocal position in this regard  the outstanding process of mediation undertaken by colombia, mexico, panama and venezuela has culminated in the contadora act on peace and cooperation in central america, which we hope will be signed as soon as possible  it is clear that, while the actions of the contadora group have received the encouragement and backing of the united nations and the international community, this final stage of overriding importance requires the full, active and complementary support of the countries of the latin american region particular and of the international community as a whole  we wish to record our gratitude and express our encouragement to the central american countries which have already stated their willingness to sign this important document similarly, we share the view that assistance from countries with ties to the central american region would be highly desirable to ensure the effective implementation of the contadora act  we believe that the best way of achieving this important goal would be through a determined effort of solidarity by latin america that would eliminate or at least reduce to a minimum a certain element of confrontation, directly or indirectly, in our hemisphere that could affect the situation in central america it is the duty of latin america as a whole to promote the detente and understanding that would effectively guarantee the establishment of peace in the region  the parties involved must therefore make reciprocal concessions which, in turn, provide mutual benefits, principally in the important areas of national security and economic and social development it has been an invariable tenet of the foreign policy of the dominican republic that any type of colonial domination, whatever form it might take, must be rejected  in line with this attitude, we note with concern that there are still areas of the world under colonial domination  these constitute sources of unrest and tension in the sphere of international relations and endanger international peace and security one persistent source of unrest is the disregard of the legitimate claim of the argentine republic to territorial sovereignty over the malvinas  we regret the lack of progress at the meeting at berne last july between representatives of the governments of argentina and the united kingdom  we cordially urge the governments of argentina and the united kingdom to resume their negotiations, and we reiterate our support for the renewed mission of good offices undertaken by the secretarygeneral with a view to assisting the parties to those negotiations the insecurity and sufferings of peoples are not limited to one geographical area  i should like to refer to other events, topics and circumstances which affect international life and are of concern to the government of the dominican republic first, i wish to express the dominican republic profound anxiety over the situation prevailing in southern africa  a mere glance at this part of the world shows us that apartheid, racial discrimination and colonial domination continue blindly to resist the natural and legitimate forces of social change  the heroic struggle of the peoples of southern africa for selfdetermination must receive the most decisive support of the international community i reaffirm the full solidarity of the dominican people with the people of namibia and our unreserved support for the struggle being waged by swapo, the legitimate representative of the namibian people, for the liberation of their territory and the establishment of an independent state based on the principles of equality, freedom and justice among the disturbed regions of the world, the middle east has been a constant source of concern to the united nations since the organization inception  my country unswervingly maintains its position that the achievement of a just and lasting peace in the region requires prior acceptance of the view that the question of palestine is the core of the middle east situation we therefore urge, as we have on previous occasions, that the necessary conditions be fostered to enable the palestinian people to exercise, without any kind of outside interference or coercion, its right to selfdetermination, including its right to national independence and political sovereignty and to establish a state on palestinian territory we reiterate equally strongly our heartfelt conviction that any peace solution in the middle east must take into consideration security council resolution (, which recognizes the right of israel to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries no less worrying is the situation in lebanon— a country with traditional ties to the dominican republic—which is cruelly torn by fratricidal battles  we believe that now more than ever the paths of dialogue and negotiation should be explored there and that the international community is morally obliged to extend its full cooperation to the reconstruction process in lebanon however, unanimous recognition of the need for the restoration of the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of lebanon and the withdrawal from its territory of all unauthorized foreign forces is an essential prerequisite for the settlement of the conflict the war between the islamic republic of iran and iraq is taking its toll in death and destruction on both sides and is adversely affecting prospects of regional and global peace and security  we believe that the international organizations should be prepared to help and encourage the peacemaking process between the parties we reaffirm our belief that the desired reunification of the korean people should be achieved through a negotiated settlement between the two parties, without outside interference or pressure one of the sustaining pillars of dominican foreign policy is nonintervention in the internal affairs of other states  this has been a historical constant, evident throughout the life of our republic  however, we consider that nonintervention is closely linked to another cardinal principle of international life: the selfdetermination of peoples  the dominican republic has invariably shown firm support for the right of peoples freely to decide the form of government they deem most suited to their national interests our deep attachment to these principles impels us to express before this assembly of the international community our profound concern at the situation prevailing in several parts of the world where foreign interference is damaging the sacred attributes of national sovereignty and independence  in this connection, we affirm our absolute rejection of the presence of foreign troops in afghanistan, kampuchea, lebanon, central america, africa and anywhere else that this situation exists the government of the dominican republic views with deep concern the upsurge of acts of terrorism in international life  it has condemned these and will always condemn them wherever they occur  we believe the recourse to terror, in any form and for any motive, is unacceptable to the international community and offends its conscience on the subject of scourges, i should like to refer to the quito declaration against traffic in narcotic drugs, signed by the presidents of bolivia, colombia, ecuador and venezuela, by the representative of the president of peru, by the presidentelect of panama, by a member of the governing junta of national reconstruction of nicaragua and by the vicepresident of panama at quito on august  we associate ourselves fully with the approach adopted in that declaration—that is, to consider traffic in narcotics as a crime against humanity, with all the legal consequences applicable in such cases  we also support the proposal for the establishment of an international or regional fund to furnish aid to developing countries affected by traffic in narcotics, in order to combat and overcome the causes responsible for such situations and to provide the competent national institutions with suitable instruments to deal with such activities the international community is still being battered by the worst world economic crisis of recent decades  despite some signs of recovery observed in certain industrialized economies, the international recession persists and the thirdworld countries— particularly those in latin america—are still beset by economic stagnation and subjected to painful processes of adjustment which in the main are ineffective because of the lack of equity and symmetry in the distribution of the costs of international economic restructuring from the second united nations development decade, the , which held promise of a transfer of real resources to the developing areas, we have moved into a period dominated by the group and sectoral interests of some industrialized countries which, not fully realizing that we live in an interdependent world, have caused a reversal of financial assistance flows, leading to restrictions on market access and the pursuit of economic policies that have upset the international economic order consequently, the sustained economic growth of a few years ago has come to a halt  our peoples' purchasing power in strong currencies has dwindled  world trade is at a standstill  a dramatic shortage of international liquidity is threatening the stability of the financial and monetary system the thirdworld countries, which set their sights on industrialization during the  in the hope of absorbing growing unemployment, find that important industrial sectors cannot grow satisfactorily because the developed countries' economies, deprived of comparative advantages, are imposing quotas and restrictions on our principal exports one example is sugar, the underpinning and the mainstay of economies such as that of my country  sugar is subjected to subsidies and protectionist measures which some developed countries extend to their producers and which are one of the main reasons for the decline in the world price of this commodity  in addition, the united states has just reduced by per cent the sugar quotas assigned to our countries  this measure is contrary to the philosophy underlying the promising initiative for the caribbean basin sponsored by that country these protectionist measures show the extent to which the world economy may be destabilized if this type of behaviour continues to spread  if the countries that are most competitive in selling certain goods cannot find outlets for their production or do not obtain suitable prices for their commodities, where will they obtain the international liquidity to purchase goods from abroad or to finance the servicing of their eternal debt clearly, the answer cannot be that this liquidity should be achieved at the expense of the standard of living of our peoples, because that solution would be economically unfair and politically and socially destabilizing and would have implications that could even endanger the international financial and monetary system itself during the  and , the relationship existing between trade and development was reflected principally in the fact that the surpluses generated by trade were recycled in the form of investments and loans  by contrast, the present trend is to concentrate capital inputs on the basis of incentives to encourage high interest rates and other measures involving substantial restrictions on international trade high interest rates are aggravating the external debt problem, by increasing financial costs  thus, latin america will have to pay out over $billion more than it would have had to pay out if the united states base rate had not risen by three points since the beginning of this year  in turn, the existence of such high interest rates encourages the outflow of capital to the financial centres, thus further reducing the capacity to pay and the international liquidity of our economies  that is one reason why latin america, deeply in debt, has paradoxically become a net exporter of capital the figures supporting this statement are chilling  in net terms, latin america is transferring to the industrialized countries over per cent of its gross domestic product  in over $billion, representing half of the region net savings, were transferred as interest and profits alone  debt servicing—interest alone—absorbs per cent of latin american exports  in the past four years, the region output declined by percent, and unemployment is still on the rise the severe deflation into which the developing countries' economies have been led, in order to create conditions in which debtservicing payments can be made, has undoubtedly reduced the threat looming over the financial order of the developed countries  but this has been achieved through severe, indeed traumatic, curtailments of imports and of consumption, through a decrease in the already precarious standard of living of our peoples and, in many cases, through disruption of social peace owing to the sacrifices required of peoples with fewer resources available to them my country, which has suffered at first hand the rigours of this crisis and the consequences of economic adjustments, cannot remain indifferent to this distressing social picture, which is working against the united nations ideal of creating the necessary conditions of stability and wellbeing for peaceful and friendly relations among nations faced with the serious phenomenon of external indebtedness, which as has been seen, has significant adverse effects on them, the latin american countries have—it must be recognized—already set in train a dynamic process of solidarity, which is increasingly becoming an example for the third world and which is backed by firm political will the quito declaration and plan of action preceded by the santo domingo undertaking, and more recently the cartagena consensus and the mar del plata communique are eloquent expressions of this solidarity and of this common will, whose main objective is to find a solution to the serious problems identified during the dialogue and to achieve understanding between all the parties concerned—in other words, between creditors and debtors this was clearly stated by the president of the dominican republic, mr  salvador jorge blanco, in a speech made at the university of south carolina, before the president of the united states, mr  ronald reagan, and other leaders of the caribbean community  he said:at cartagena, we acknowledged the need to restructure our economies, to make the adjustments which will enable us to exercise selfdiscipline, but we also proclaimed the necessary joint responsibility for the solution of the crisis borne by the governments of the creditor countries, the international banks and the international financial organizations the countries which joined in the cartagena consensus reaffirmed at mar del plata the need for direct political dialogue between creditors and debtors which would recognize the joint responsibility of all in the search for solutions to the crisis and lead to the achievement of a fairer economic order as the provisional secretariat of the consultation and followup machinery established under the cartagena consensus, the dominican republic will do everything in its power to help bring about the proposed political dialogue which, as stated at mar del plata, should preferably be held during the first half of  this political dialogue would also serve as an opportunity to review the role played by important international agencies such as the imf and the world bank in the international economic order as we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the solemn proclamation by the general assembly of the new international economic order, we note with regret that the attitude of some industrialized countries is hindering the start of the global negotiations, the result being that the northsouth dialogue on international economic cooperation is being kept in a state of virtual paralysis there is still no progress in the negotiations, despite the notable flexibility of the nonaligned countries and the group of  as evidenced at their most recent meetings, and despite the fact that the developed countries acknowledged at their economic summit meetings, such as those held at williamsburg in and in london last june, the global nature of the international crisis and the interdependence which must necessarily exist between north and south nevertheless, as shown by the report of the committee on the review and appraisal of the implementation of the international development strategy for the third united nations development decade, the industrialized countries are having difficulty in taking measures consonant with the agreed principles the proposals submitted at the sixth session of the united nations conference on trade and development, held at belgrade from june to july  proposals that were the fruit of concerted action involving representatives of approximately nations from three continents, were rejected—yet another example of the meagre responses of the industrialized countries, whose last two summit conferences, instead of giving rise to expectations and fostering hopes, caused painful frustrations the recently concluded fourth general conference of the united nations industrial development organization, held at vienna from to august, again provided a forum for a demonstration of the inflexibility of the most powerful nations in the face of the urgent need to promote a more stable economic order, showing that the voice of the third world at the end of the century is heard almost as a monologue of over voices rather than as part of a dialogue this obliges us to ponder the need for an effective expansion of southsouth cooperation in all spheres, since this would create better prospects for the strengthening of our economies, without any intention of diverting trade into exclusively horizontal patterns, because we fully recognize the high degree of interdependence prevailing m northsouth relations  this would not prevent our countries, which have very marked common interests, from strengthening their mutual trade, deliberately and with a very clear political will, in pursuit of the goal of remedying even partially the unequal treatment to which we are subjected we trust that the critical international economic situation will be a factor accelerating the informal consultations being held at the united nations on the subject of global negotiations  at the end of this session of the general assembly, we hope to have significant agreement in the area of global negotiations, the continued postponement of which is a source of discouragement to the developing countries before concluding, i should like to say that my country, which is host to the international research and training institute for the advancement of women, is extremely pleased to note the very efficient and capable work of the institute in the performance of its vital tasks  we hope that the international community will continue to extend its support to this dynamic institute  this new autonomous united nations body is devoting its efforts to training and to the dissemination of information on the link existing between the development process and the situation of each individual in particular in this context, we must state that the modern world seems to have understood that when international relations are subordinated to the interests of the rich countries, the problems and aspirations of the vast majority of the developing countries—all seeking diversified and democratic solutions to the world crisis—are ignored international conflicts assume a much more complex character with unforeseeable consequences when due consideration is not given to the particular identity of our peoples and to the very special needs which they have at the various stages of their evolution and growth the approach of the fortieth anniversary of the united nations will provide a very propitious occasion for a review of our international system and of its efficiency  we attach vital importance to the level of understanding and knowledge possessed by the peoples of the world on the subject of the united nations, so that mankind can identify with the principles, spirit and ideals of its charter forty, for the united nations, is an age of maturity and experience, of vigour and of youth  to reflect on the commitments assumed by this universal organization for the solution of conflicts, for disarmament, for human rights, for justice and for cooperation, is to realize that we all belong to one and the same community, which must seek peace and development through solidarity in reiterating on this occasion the firm support of the government of the dominican republic for the principles of the charter of the united nations, we urge the members of the international community to strengthen the organization, so that it may really serve as a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends  mr  balaguer said that it was the first time that the general assembly of the united nations had met on the soil of france, the mother of liberty and the cradle of human rights  if the atmosphere of the world were at present less charged with anxiety and if the shadow of a fresh catastrophe did not darken the future of humanity, it would have been said that that change of headquarters, apart from whatever other motives involved, fulfilled a purpose of incalculable moral value  the three regular sessions of the assembly of the united nations had been held in the three countries of the world which most strongly represented the principles of political freedom and of respect for individual rights  the united nations organization, born in san francisco, had been initiated in london; it had drawn its first breath in england, as though it had been desired that the representatives of all the nations should strengthen their faith in the renewal of liberty by the splendid sight of a famous people which had just arisen from the ruins of war, as a symbol of the indestructibility of the human spirit and as a symbol of justice and right — values which would never die, however persecuted the general assembly had then moved to the united states of america, the most powerful democracy on earth and the home of the people which had decided the issue of the tremendous conflict by throwing into the balance the most formidable fighting machine that the world had ever seen the capital of france, the country which, with the encyclopedists, had seen the birth of the loftiest ideals of modern political thought, now welcomed the united nations  france, a great country, which was the pride of latin culture, would by its history give the moral impulse required to overcome the feelings of distrust and pessimism which were beginning to undermine the foundations of the united nations as in its last days they had those of the league of nations the dominican republic, heir, like all the latin american countries, to a french culture which almost from the beginning of nationhood was identical with that of spain, had come to the assembly in the hope that the atmosphere there would inspire the representatives of the great powers, in whose hands was the fate of all humanity, to come to a friendly agreement which would remove once and for all the danger of a new world war, which, if it happened, would be the third ordeal which civilization would have had to undergo in the short course of one generation the contribution that a small country like the dominican republic and many others which were taking part in the assembly on the same basis, protected by the inalienable principle of equal sovereignty, could make for the cause of world peace and recovery, was undoubtedly small  but within those limitations, which were necessarily imposed by its area and by the opportunities open to it, his country was proud of the faithful way in which it had carried out the terms of the san francisco charter and of the sacrifices it had made to join, to the extent permitted by its resources, in the gigantic task of world moral and economic reconstruction  the foundation of the united nations charter, as also that of the covenant of the league of nations, was respect for the rule of law, the essential condition of the peaceful coexistence of states within the supreme order of international relations  in the secretarygeneral’s annual report, the dominican republic had been mentioned among those members of the united nations which had accepted without reservation the compulsory jurisdiction of the international court of justice  the dominican republic had thereby shown its firm intention to have recourse at all times to the processes of law for the settlement of its disputes with other countries in the secretarygeneral’s report, the dominican republic had also been mentioned among those countries which had offered their protection and help to the children of the war devastated nations of europe  ever since the united nations, by the creation of the international children’s emergency fund, had begun its efforts on behalf of war orphans, his country had considered that the american nations, for the very reason that they were furthest from the wardarkened scene and had best escaped the terrible moral consequences of the war, were among those which should take a leading part in that magnificent humanitarian crusade  his country would accordingly, through the initiative of its president, contribute dollars to the children’s emergency fund, and it had, at a co of nearly dollars, constructed a building which was even now ready for the reception and lodging of european children in all the other fields of activity of the united nations, his government had associated itself strongly with the unprecedented task to which the united nations was pledged: the task of restoring to the world its lost confidence and stability  apart from its work in the interim committee, where it had upheld several important recommendations such as those relating to mediation and peaceful means of settling disputes, his country had, during the year covered in the secretarygeneral’s last report, given the maximum amount of cooperation to the united nations, not only in the economic but also in the moral and legal fields turning to his country’s position in relation to the items of the agenda which would attract the greatest attention, mr  balaguer said that his country belonged to the american continent, a part of the world where there had been set up standards for the coexistence of nations which in many cases, if only by reason of the respect with which they were viewed, had superseded the traditional standards of law two of the most important items of the agenda for his country were the problems of greece and of spain  both those problems were essentially one from the legal point of view, for both were closely connected with the principle of the noninfringement of sovereignty and of the noninterference of a state in the domestic affairs of another state  when those problems came under discussion, the dominican republic would not fall into the contradiction characterizing the attitude of those countries which were strong protagonists of the principle of nonintervention when their own interests were involved or the interests of supporting ideological regimes but which were opposed to the same fundamental principle — the essential basis of relationships between states — when the governments of countries of a different ideology were involved  the great powers, which as such held the fate of the weak states in their hands and by their power had an influence upon the destiny of the world, could allow themselves such contradictions and at times confuse right with political expediency; but the smaller powers, whose only protection was the principle, so often ignored in the history of international relationships, of the legal equality of sovereign states, could not with impunity turn their backs upon legal and moral standards which guaranteed their selfdetermination and represented for them the great armies and the guns of the great powers  the fate of the small nations, which were in the great majority in the assembly, would assuredly be very precarious if they took part in the discussions guided only by political interest and ideological passion  if they did, there would happen to them what had happened to diomedes, who died, devoured by the very horses he had taught to eat human flesh  men and governments were ephemeral, and the only enduring realities in the life of peoples were moral principles and the rule of law; unchanging conceptions that every country should preserve, surrounded, like the vestal virgins of old, by a kind of holy inviolability  if, by dislike for a political system or by doctrinal scruples, the small nations were to abandon any of the rigid principles of morality or right, they would merely betray the vital interests of their peoples and, blinded by the mirage of the nonessential, sell the birthright of future generations the dominican republic would conform to the same standards in discussing items of the agenda involving legal questions concerned with the domestic jurisdiction of states  in the discussion of problems such as that raised by chile in relation to the ussr and that concerning the treatment of indians in the union of south africa, his delegation would favour solutions ensuring respect for the traditional principles of public law which at the same time did not intrude upon the private domain of national sovereignty if it were possible to find a more liberal interpretation of certain articles of the charter, such as those relating to the right of veto which had been set up for the benefit of the great powers, the dominican republic would, without hesitation, join the group of weak countries which desired the reduction to a minimum of the irritating privilege of the veto which violated for political purposes the principle, that , could not be surrendered, of the equality of states mr  balaguer affirmed, in conclusion, his faith in the work of the united nations  that organization was the only ark afloat amid universal shipwreck, the only legacy of human solidarity left to a sceptical and ruined world that had survived the horrors of war, and it would, as the secretarygeneral had so well said in his report, undoubtedly serve to bring the great powers together and lead them to continue the conversations begun at san francisco  but it also served, and that was of great importance, to keep alive the vacillating faith of the small nations in justice and right  the representatives of all the free peoples of the world, when they returned every year after a session of the assembly, carried back to their own countries fewer hopes than they had had when they set out  but, despite their discouragement, when they summed up the work accomplished yearly on behalf of peace and realized that nothing positive had been done, they nevertheless preserved intact their faith in international justice, because for weeks on end they had been present at discussions in which the powerful nations had bowed on many occasions, in obedience to the provisions of the charter, before the will of countries which lacked the power to make themselves heard on the field of battle, and because they knew that the very existence of the united nations was in itself a guarantee of order and a call to reason in the midst of universal anxiety and anarchy  in the list of items proposed for the agenda of the present session of the general assembly, one on which the collective measures committee has made a very thorough report is particularly outstanding: “ methods which might be used to maintain and strengthen international peace and security in accordance with the purposes and principles of the charter ” the inclusion of this item holds out ground for hope, because all, or almost all, the political items in the agenda might yield results, could we but attain unanimity of opinion and resolve upon the adoption of such methods  questions like the international control of atomic energy or the reduction and limitation of armaments could be solved provided we first reach general agreement on the manner in which peace is to be maintained and strengthened  we should also be on the way to finding practical and useful solutions for problems like those connected with the threats to the political independence and territorial integrity of certain members of this world organization  if we attain agreement on methods, we shall have gone halfway towards putting them into effect i therefore attach the utmost importance to the item arising out of the report of the collective measures committee, for, if we were to succeed in taking a unanimous decision on it we should be able, sooner or later, to solve all the other political problems before us nevertheless, the prospect before us is not encouraging  from the very first meeting of this session the sharp division of opinion on political problems has made itself felt  at earlier sessions, as we set to work, we were hopeful of reaching practical results in the political sphere and it was only as the days went by that the deep divergence of views became apparent, postponing the adoption of a concerted plan for peace and security  our initial feeling of optimism was replaced by discouragement and scepticism i trust that on this occasion the reverse will be the case; i trust that the initial disappointment will very soon be replaced by renewed hope and faith  or are we to believe the prophets who say that a new war is imminent  i cannot and will not believe that there is any nation which would dare to take upon itself the responsibility for unleashing a new world struggle which would shatter the achievements of civilization and our dearest and most fervent hopes of achieving a better future for mankind is it possible that once again, wherever we turn our eyes, we shall see suffering, terror and desolation  is it possible that once again death and destruction will rain from the skies, that tanks will ravage the fields made fertile by the farmer’s patient toil, that whole cities will disappear in a day as though by an evil spell, and that with them thousands of noncombatants will perish sacrificed to homicidal mania, old men awaiting a peaceful death in prayer or meditation, innocent children just awakening with a smile to the delights of life  is it possible that we should return to barbarism and that the spiritual forces which constitute the dignity of the human mind should be unavailing to prevent it, as though, stripping ourselves of the attributes of civilization, which has nurtured and fostered the noble collective ideals of mankind, we were to return to grope our way blindly through the dark forests of instinct no! we abjure the appalling nightmare  war should now be a moral impossibility and all men must unite in their resolve to condemn it as such  and the best means of securing that end and avoiding war is the study and adoption of effective methods for the maintenance of international peace and security clearly, if the adoption of such methods is to be wholly efficacious, it is vital that we should achieve that effective universality to which the united nations aspires; another item on our agenda, that relating to the admission of new members, tends towards that end if all peaceloving nations which observe the principles of the charter are to be admitted to the united nations, it is unreasonable that, in the absence of any evidence that they have departed from those principles, the door of the united nations should be shut against them by the arbitrary mechanism which is known as the “rule of unanimity” but which should rather be termed the “ privilege of the veto ”  i do not propose at this point to discuss, the privileges enjoyed by the permanent members of the security council because of their greater responsibility for the destiny of mankind, but i consider it excessive, in the matter of the admission of new members, that they should  have the power, by the mere casting of a single negative vote, to prevent the entry of other states into the united nations such a course might result in inconsistent and illogical decisions  take, for instance, the case of libya; suppose that, after the general assembly has decided to set up an independent state there, when the time comes to put that decision into effect and, as a natural consequence of its fulfillment, to admit libya to the united nations, the new nation, created by the will of the assembly, were prevented from taking its place among us for lack of a necessary vote in the security council  that situation has already arisen in the case of the republic of korea which was established by the united nations and which has been the scene of the outbreak of the most serious conflict with which the united nations has so far been faced  the case of korea is such; that we can safely say that it is putting to the test the integrity and resolution which our organization must display if it is to survive insecurity and disagreement hang like threatening shadows over the work to which we have set our hands  even so, the united nations presses on with its task of bettering the political structure of the world and ensuring the wellbeing of all nations in the economic field, an indication of the paramount importance of our work, is given by the most comprehensive and important of the items to be considered by the second committee: the economic development of underdeveloped countries, under three heads, financing, land reform and technical assistance similarly, in the social field, efforts are being continued to improve the position of refugees and stateless persons and to give the latter a status, while progress has also been made with the draft international covenant on human rights the work carried on, with increasing efficiency, by the trusteeship council has produced a number of important items for discussion by the fourth committee, including the rural economic development of the trust territories, the abolition of corporal punishment and the development of administrative unions affecting trust territories; to these items we must add the consideration of information from nonselfgoverning territories  because of their substance, two items which involve points of fundamental legal importance are also to be dealt with by the fourth committee: the question of southwest africa and the question of the full participation of italy in the work of the trusteeship council,the fifth committee will as usual have to consider the administrative and financial work of the organization; and, lastly, the sixth committee has to consider various problems of special importance in the development of law, beginning with the report of the international law commission  in some cases, because the subjects under consideration are new, it is important that states members should have more time to study them, which is the reason why the general committee has recommended that the discussion of the draft code of offences against peace and security of mankind should be postponed until the seventh session  in other eases, for example, the draft declaration on rights and duties of states, objections have already been raised regarding the inclusion of certain principles which, being new, cannot be regarded as being fully incorporated in positive law and which, in the view of certain states members, are a counsel of perfection in the development of law, although they do not believe that they have yet reached the point when they should be accepted as rules of law  the latin american nations have already embodied many of these principles in positive form within the framework of the organization of american states and will not, therefore, have any objection to them, but they may seek means of finding common ground with those members which regard them only as a counsel of perfection  i feel sure, in short, that acceptable solutions can be found to avoid delay in the approval and adoption of the draft,thug, the united nations is continuing without pause the constructive work on which it has embarked  if our efforts could achieve as much in the political as in the technical field, the success of the united nations would be decisive and complete  there is, however, no cause to be fainthearted  we must cherish the hope that, though the road be rough and difficult, we shall, for the good of humanity, succeed in ensuring that the purposes and principles of the united nations charter finally prevail throughout the world (translated from french) i do not wish to conclude without paying tribute to our host, immortal france  i shall therefore try, albeit haltingly, to express in the grand tongue of renan and chateaubriand my hope that the glorious spirit of france may be a source of inspiration to us in the accomplishment of our work  france, above all countries, has, throughout its history, professed and maintained with ardent faith the cult of beauty, the mind and liberty  \\ufeffthe international community iscurrently going through a period of reflection and selfdefinition  the great transformations that humanityexperienced during the course of the previous decade,as well as current challenges, demand greaterresponsibility on the part of our nations in playing anactive role in the search for urgent solutions to theproblems that are affecting us  this new session of thegeneral assembly presents us with an excellentopportunity to achieve that goal today, the dominican republic reaffirms itscommitment to peace, the defence of human rights,security, sustainable development and thestrengthening of democracy — pillars of indisputableimportance in safeguarding international peace andstability the issue of the reform of the united nations hasbeen on our agenda for a long time  events of recentyears make it clear that this task must be undertaken asa matter of priority  the reform the security council isparticularly urgent  ever since the approval ofresolution of december  we have beenengaged in an ongoing debate on the various reformproposals  now, however, it is time to act to restructurethe council so as to make it more representative andequitable, as well as more transparent in its decisionmaking, thereby strengthening its legitimacy as theguarantor of international peace and security terrorism has emerged as an ongoing threat tohumanity  uncertainty and pain have characterized thebeginning of the twentyfirst century  our nations havethe challenge of fighting together, at a global level,against the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction and in favour of equitable development andfree societies  security problems call for decisiveaction against international terrorism, organized crimeand the illegal trade in arms and drugs the millennium summit established as one of itsmain goals the reduction of poverty by per cent by notwithstanding some progress in theachievement of those goals, poverty remains a terriblescourge  the dominican government, which considersthat issue to be one of great importance, has created asocial cabinet to act as a coordinating mechanism forall governmental institutions for social welfare, and ishelping to ensure that both national and internationalresources are distributed equitably and allocated toregions that require social investment all countries must join efforts, acceptingresponsibilities, both shared and separate, to guaranteethat growth and poverty do not go together and that, inmeeting the needs of the present generation, we do notcause the destruction of future generations’ capacity tomeet their own needs the positive outcome of the fourth ministerialconference of the world trade organization, held indoha, qatar, in november  and of theinternational conference on financing fordevelopment held in monterrey, mexico, in march was a key element for achieving millenniumdevelopment goals  the doha development agendaand the monterrey consensus provided a framework tofacilitate market access, improve multilateralregulations for channelling globalization and increasefinancial aid for development however, we must mention what happened at thefifth ministerial conference of the world tradeorganization (wto) recently held in cancún, mexico although agreement was not reached because offundamental differences in the positions regardingessential world trade issues, we are convinced that thiswill not affect the multilateral system of negotiations on the contrary, some member states maintain that thisimpasse may even be necessary to shape moreequitable international agreements at the heart of thewto  what is an important issue is not to lose thedevelopment perspective within the work programmeof the wto, as set in the doha development agenda,because that agenda includes the aspirations of millionsof people around the world, whose hope for progresslies in the opportunities of the global economy the position of the dominican government withregard to the middle east conflict is based primarily onunconditional adherence to the norms and principles ofinternational law, particularly those related to thepeaceful solution of disputes; condemning the use offorce and terrorism in all its forms; complying in goodfaith with international treaties; and on strictobservance of resolutions of the united nations and itsdeliberative bodies devoted to these principles, the dominicanrepublic has, in response to the humanitarian appealsof the security council, participated in the efforts torebuild iraq, in order to contribute to the developmentof a secure and stable environment in which thesovereignty of the iraqi people may be restored similarly, our country supports the peace processoutlined in the road map submitted by the united statesof america and endorsed by the russian federation,the united nations and the european union  weunderstand that a cessation of violence cannot bepostponed, along with the historic pledges of all partiesto make sacrifices to promote a lasting solution to theconflict and peaceful coexistence drawing up sustainable development policiescalls for dealing with problems before they emerge this implies making headway in achieving themillennium development goals, particularly on crucialissues such as energy and protection of theenvironment  in this respect, our nation reiterates itsrejection of the international maritime transport ofradioactive and toxic waste, a position which has beenexpressed in other international forums  this issue islinked to international security the importance of guaranteeing women equalrights and equity, and promoting their increasedpolitical participation, has been a continuous concernof the heads of state in various international forums the international research and training institute forthe advancement of women (instraw), the onlyinstitution within the united nations system dedicatedexclusively to that end, has its headquarters in santodomingo, capital of the dominican republic  thedominican government calls upon member states tocontinue supporting the work of instraw in thedominican republic by providing contributions, to theextent that they can our country commends the culture of peace, andis making efforts to ensure that at the primary levelchildren are taught about promoting mutualunderstanding and learn about civics and human rights similarly, we believe that a solid and permanentdemocracy is an achievable goal  the challenges hereare clear: growing democracy, more respect for civicrights, freedom of the press; freedom of expression ofpolitical parties and public opinion; dignity andtransparency of all leaders and the moral legitimacy ofall deeply concerned about the spread of hiv/aidsin our nation, the government has made great efforts tocomply with the commitments entered into in thedeclaration on fighting this terrible disease  we call forincreased international cooperation and efforts toguarantee the availability of drugs at affordable prices,based on the doha declaration on intellectual propertyand the right to health the dominican republic salutes with optimismthe role played by the united nations and theorganization of american states (oas) in efforts todevelop humanitarian aid programmes for the haitianpeople  it is imperative to stress here the need forgreater support from the international community forour neighbouring republic of haiti and its neglectedpopulation although we are aware that this issue has beenexcluded from the agenda of the current session , wewish to state our support for the aspirations of therepublic of china, taiwan, to rejoin this organization,of which it was a member for many years  our positionis in line with the universal principles contained in thecharter, the basis of the rules of international law andthe historical tradition of friendly relations withtaiwan on behalf of the dominican government, sir,may i congratulate you on your election as president,confident that your conduct of this session will besuccessful, beneficial for the international communityand a source of pride to your country, saint lucia, andthus to our caribbean community i also wish to express the dominicangovernment’s rejection of the barbaric act perpetratedagainst the united nations mission in baghdad on august, and to reiterate to the families of mr  sergiovieira de mello and of the other deceased colleaguesour most heartfelt condolences we are all aware of the great challengesconfronting humanity  our future depends on theactions we take now  we have the opportunity to meetthe expectations of the nations of the world  let us takeup this challenge with all due responsibility  allow me first to express the congratulations of our delegation on the keen perception with which the general assembly has chosen mr  amerasinghe to preside over this session containing in its agenda issues for study and decision of great importance to states members of die united nations  we are certain that his privileged experience and his wisdom will facilitate the achievement of our common purpose in the search for just solutions as well as in the results of our deliberations  let us then hope that, guided by the values he represents, we will be able to say at the end of our work that at this thirtyfirst session of the general assembly considerable progress has been made and that we have been able to clear up the unknown factors that have held back progress toward a new policy of understanding and effective decisionmaking in the difficult task of fulfilling the mandate imposed by the expectations of our times under the charter of our world organization i wish to convey the most heartfelt congratulations to mr  gaston thorn, prime minister and minister for foreign affairs of the grand duchy of luxembourg for the brilliant manner, the goodwill and competence with which he presided over the thirtieth session of the general assembly also wish to express the deep appreciation of my government for the effective and vigorous work of mr  kurt waldheim, the secretarygeneral of the united nations, who has so faithfully served the principles of the organization  the delegation of the dominican republic is pleased to offer its congratulations also to the republic of seychelles for having been admitted as a member of the united nations  these congratulations on behalf of my government and of the people of the dominican republic are addressed to the government of the people of the young republic of seychelles as well as to its delegation, with which we have the honor to participate in this general assembly we are here at the thirtyfirst session of the general assembly of this important body at a time when the economy of developing countries such as ours are facing difficult situations which must find a prompt and happy situation  at the same time, however, we are strengthened by the ideals which inspired the founder of the republic, juan pablo duarte, known among  us as the christ of freedomwhom all dominicans honor this year in just tribute on the centenary of his death whose selfless life was passionately and completely devoted to the emergence of a new nation in the american continent under the protection of god, the fatherland and liberty while we realize that all items to be discussed at this session are of great importance, we cannot forget the needs we are faced with, and speaking on behalf of my country i wish to mention in particular that we shall raise the problem of the sugar market with its falling prices as well as other points which have been causing a deterioration in the peaceful coexistence of nations and our very existence as states  that is why we are going to limit our considerations to those matters the idea of a collective security system has always been present in the united nations  on the other hand it is not too bold to think that it has never been more justified to see to it that its member states favor having a practical instrument, an instrument which may prove effective in preserving peace and proscribing the scourge of war so as to imbue the charter with more vigor in that field we know very well that there are innumerable obstacles to the emergence of such a mechanism because of the differences and the controversies which produce stagnation and which create a climate adverse to reconciling conflicting interestsinterests which instead of diminishing have multiplied in the last years the problem, as complex as it may be, must be viewed in the light of other criteria  among them that of the international economy is essential actually there are also reasons to consider it necessary to recognize that collective security is not possible without economic security  both causes produce the same effects: economic insecurity drives peoples to collective insecurity  thus, if the former could be attained through a process similar to an effective moratorium on the tensions produced by harsh disputes and conflicts it would be possible for peace not to be precarious, which it has been for many years, and to reduce coercion and threat which were the agents determining the instability affecting the principles embodied in the charter of our organization  these thoughts lead the delegation of the dominican republic to mention the importance which my country attaches to the charter of economic rights and duties of states [resolution (xxix)], which should not be left or considered a simple expression of purposes which have remained inoperative as so many others or which have been neglected despite the causes which led to it a review of the disturbances caused in the territories of states members of the united nations shows that violence in its most inhuman forms has not diminished but has rather increased and intensified considerably  we cannot deny that those facts have negative international implications such as the hijacking of aircraft, a subject which involves states with all the characteristics we know seizing hostages is no doubt one of the most odious forms of violent coercion  now this practice has spread to the americas, where it has created threats to public order in the form of kidnappings which defy authority to obtain the objectives pursued, disregarding the fact that the victims are actually innocent personsand this makes these deeds barbarian crimes in this danger zone of crime in the international arena we must admit that the instruments available to us so far have been ineffective to prevent or punish violations which are contrary to moral and cultural progress, in contrast to the technology which is leading us to ever deeper penetration of outer space the general assembly in previous years has been concerned with this serious situation, and the statements made on those occasions were so conservative that we could say today that they have been largely the cause of the evil we are now facing without any apparent remedy the frequency with which this type of violence occurs nil over the world makes a more thorough review necessary in order to find new, more effective instruments to check the proliferation of terrorism, hijacking and kidnapping, in all its forms, so that this evil may be halted before this covert method of warfare unleashes an international conflict which could lead to a new war it would not be an exaggeration to give priority to the idea of a preventive and corrective mechanism for this purpose, which has already been studied by the general assembly  preventive action may consist in the formula which is applicable to other cases similar to the ones we have mentioned  we think that time has come to consider terrorism to be an offense under ordinary law, taking into account not merely the motive, but the dreadful nature of the crime and the fact that its victims are innocent people  this would also provide the necessary means for the prevention and punishment of hijacking of aircraft, the holding of hostages etc  these specific offenses must be regarded as crimes against mankind, with all the legal consequences the dominican republic has attached special importance to the third united nations conference on the law of the sea and within its possibilities has lent its decided cooperation toward the adoption of a draft convention that would be viable and effective  we understand that such a task is very difficult given the opposing interests in the world today  at the same time we are largely elaborating a new law of die sea which covers greater areas than the land masses  it is obvious, on the other hand, that many of the provisions which have been proposed compel us to abandon centuriesold practicesa matter which frequently requires uncommon decisiveness and firmness  however, the reasons leading states to find a new regime for the seas are so clear and convincingnow that we must speak no longer of a mare liberum, but rather of the common heritage of mankind that we must yield to the requirements of our time before it is too late this is a challenge which we cannot neglect, since the world is beset by prospects of food scarcity in particular, and the wealth of the sea is important for survival and human progress  no one can ignore the situation, which is linked, so to speak, to a fixed timetable  the realities have placed us in a state of siege we have been disappointed to see that on many of the subjects involved in the law of the sea not only have opposite positions been taken and this has disturbed recent meetings on the subjectbut they have also made impossible the adoption of agreed formulas and have delayed the possibility of agreeing on a convention that can be adopted on time, bearing in mind the urgent need to exploit the resources of the sea, while we move towards the year the reference to food shortages and malnutrition leads us to the resolution of the world food conference,  which is of great topical importance for the problem of hunger  it is difficult to conceive that despite the importance of the international fund for agricultural development, the oilproducing countries have not contributed to that mechanism for the mobilization of agriculture, at the levels required by the urgency of that program, the implementation of which would alleviate the demand for food in critical areas and reduce the devastation brought about by malnutrition it is clear that this problem is becoming more acute and spreading everywhere, and it is that continuous projection which remains a question to which no reply has so far been forthcoming on the basis of population growth forecasts and other statistics endorsed by competent organizations the dominican republic shares the concern over the need to make use of all available resources for agricultural production with a view to attaining the maximum possible level, i e , the need to act now with a view to preventing the ills that are threatening future generations  that is why the government headed by his excellency president joaquin balaguer, not only maintains a vigorous agricultural policy but has also been gradually changing the landholding regime so as to open up more opportunities in agriculture and in all other fields of production including miningan unprecedented change  the system which has been established for agrarian reform includes recovering state lands and gradually acquiring large tracts of arable land to be turned over to the farmers  these standards constitute a true bloodless revolution, the results of which will be found in the total economic development of the country through the use of all its natural resources our delegation wishes to make special mention of the sessions of unctad through which developing countries expect to receive the means which will vigorously com tribute to trade and development  this recognition leads us to hope for the best results from a world economic survey as well as an analysis of the prospects for the second half with regard to means to speed up the transfer of real resources to developing countries on a secure, foreseeable and permanent basis we share the idea that the time has come to introduce reforms into the charter of the organization  we understand that instruments relating to world order must be revised from time to time in the light of experience  also, and for the same reason relating to changes in the life of nations, new forecasts made mandatory by the facts of international life must be incorporated into the ordering of the objectives brought about by the constitution of our system we must admit that some of the difficulties we are faced with are the result of some existing principles or of the lack of others; we must admit that these abnormalities should be largely attributed to the states themselves owing to the alternatives of international politics or to the fact that states do not subject themselves to existing principles there is very little marble that has no imperfections, says the dictum, and we can therefore say that no human endeavor is perfect  hence we can state that if the united nations is imperfect the same applies to the states that constitute it  there is therefore no reason for despair that being understood, it follows that the task we have before us requires the firm will to make the charter more effective and worthy of respect so that it will always condition the objectives for which it was established on the basis of the experience of total war, whose consequences still to some extent weigh on our present civilization there is a new manifestation of discrimination no less detrimental to mankind than those which involve the economy of states  economic discrimination leads to distrust and to fear in the states which are affected  this risks bringing about controversies and may disturb peace placing in jeopardy the basic objectives of the charter of the organization there is the risk of having a type of economic totalitarianism which would upset the international balance  it distorts the economy and applies great but unforeseeable pressureseven a kind of slaveryon the peoples directly affected  that evil should disappear since we are convinced that today the idea of domination is being replaced by that of the common heritage of mankind in addition to the realities which lead us to recognize that we are still suffering from a crisis in a law, we have the crisis in international cooperation, which may be in a covert form, and, furthermore, impedes the necessary assistance among states under the essential principle of universality for the world organization it seems that the oil crisis engendered by inflation in development centers is becoming a regressive phenomenon with inevitable characteristics, and it is occurring precisely at a time when the forecast is that the problems of population growth, unemployment and malnutrition will have doubled by the end of this century, while on the other hand production will not suffice to meet the demand for food and alleviate the tragedy of hunger  hunger is the war that can unleash war  we should therefore like to offer statements of the greatest importance for our delegation  we refer to the problem of the sugar markets whose ups and downs since have been of extraordinary importance for the economy of many exporting countries, our own among them the history of the efforts made in order to stabilize basic commodities would take too long even to summarize  on the other hand, it is well known by all, and therefore we need not recount what has occurred hitherto  rather, we would like to start from now and to look for solutions that are positive, just and mutually advantageous for exporting countries as well as for importers  the former wish to have security with regard to surplus supplies and their consequential depressing effect on prices  the latter need protection from scarcity and violently inflationary prices  consequently it would seem that the obstacles to a harmonious marketing of many raw materials and sugar is a case in pointdepend on hew the parties interpret that is just and reasonable, and we must admit that it is not easy to attain unanimity on definitions  it is, however, a challenge, and the best opportunity available to mankind today to take the initiative on a subject as vital as international commodity agreements, if we wish to attain positive facts free from that endless rhetoric to which we are used, is international cooperation which is meaningful to producers, consumers, exporters and importers one of those agreements can be envisaged  unctad has already set in motion the convening of an international sugar conference for april  there are many documents ready for the preparatory work and experts have examined in detail the possibilities of laying down the basis to eliminate from the resulting convention the concept of exploiters and exploited, which would be frustrating for all parties first of all we think it essential to maintain a certain relationship between production costs and prices in the light of the results obtained by the efficient producers  in this regard we should point out that production costs, for totally extraneous reasons which have nothing to do with the recognized efficiency of some producers, haveas is the case of our countryincreased for entirely extraneous reasons  it is a fact that, due to the influence of the higher oil prices and the inflationary trends prevailing all over the world, the cost of the input essential to produce sugar and other consumer goods has risen astronomically  in a document presented some months ago to the international sugar organization there is a comparison, as an example, between the costs of these goods in and the costs in  for example, fertilizers in some instances went up from $to $per metric tonper cent in the case of ureaand in others from $to $ the price of super phosphate tripled  herbicides, according to the same chart, have generally doubled in price, and the same can be said of some equipment  oil f o b  the persian gulf increased from $to $ these are figures taken at random but they are quite representative for our purposes here it is thus obvious that maintaining price levels for sugar and other export commodities similar to those prevailing at the beginning of this decade would be, and they are indeed right now, simply ruinous to the countries whose national income and whose balanceofpayments depends substantially on them  it is in the light of this situation fraught with serious consequences for the development and the wellbeing of the less developed nations that we must in a broad spirit of international solidarity focus on the search for a solution which can and must be found within the framework of the negotiations towards a new international sugar agreement  however, pending the adoption of a new international instrument on this subject we must adopt measures which would henceforth prevent a greater disruption in the international prices of sugar inestimable and adverse consequences arise when world sugar production and consumption, according to the best estimates available, barely amount the million short tons without any great surpluses to depress prices  we car safely say that in the present world situation, where there are such pressing needs, to speak of a sugar surplus is most erroneous that is why we are faced with a situation which we thought had been superseded and would not be repeated, since we believed that market forces would moderate the traditional sharp rises and drops which have frequently curbed the expansion and prosperity of one of the most strategic industries in the agricultural sector in this century  furthermore, we thought that sugar cane production was no longer one more raw material widely marketed throughout the world  that concept has been superseded owing to the production of valuable byproducts obtained in the industrialization process the many applications of sugar cane byproducts in modern industry, which lacks essential raw materials, made it impossible to think that an asset of that magnitude would not with a full expansion of the world economy respond to the real demands for all these goods  however, since the real forces of the market have not taken over, the industries of many exporting countries are being forced into bankruptcy, since, because of declining prices, they will have to cut back production acreage, not process existing crops, close down their factories and declare bankruptcy  however, after the contraction has been fully felt, after marginal producers have been eliminated, and after the supply of what appears to be surpluses has been reduced, prices will again rise, consumer countries will be increasingly concerned and will lift import restrictions, encourage the use of sweeteners, offer incentives to domestic production and resort to marketing mechanisms to depress prices  it is shameful that in this century we, producers and consumers alike, are so incapable of preventing this game from playing itself out in front of everyone without taking into account that not only the interests of poor countries are included but also the very sustenance of thousands of workers, their economic and political stability and above all the supply of foodstuffs for human consumption our delegation sincerely believes in the goodwill of countries represented here to coordinate their interests at this crucial moment in the history of mankind  in this regard we think it pertinent to express in general lines the position of the dominican republic on this very important matter, for the destiny of our countries and in general for the world in which we have to live in the annual report submitted to the national assembly on february the president of the republic, mr  joaquin balaguer, defined the position of our country with regard to the meeting which was to be held in puerto plata by the group of sugarexporting countries of latin america and the caribbean as follows and i quote:“in effect, in the same manner in which the increase in the price of oil and its derivatives disrupted even the economy of industrialized nations, an excessive hike in our export products, such as sugar or coffee, could wreak havoc on the economy of countries which may be forced to acquire those products on extremely hard terms “the best contribution that could be made by the latin american countries which export their raw materials to the highly industrialized countries of the area would be not to aggravate, through a disproportionate increase in their raw materials, the crisis brought about by the rise in the prices of oil and its derivatives  it would be preferable for consumer and producer countries alike to reach an agreement establishing fair prices for sugar, coffee, cocoa, etc  these new prices must be set at levels which allow developing countries to pay the high price brought today by the fuel needed to run their economy, and which enable consumer countries to obtain latin american raw materials at prices which are acceptable and equitable for both parties\""
